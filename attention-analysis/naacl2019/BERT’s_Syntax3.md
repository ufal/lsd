# BERT‚Äôs Syntax




----------




## Take aways (20.11.2019)


1. There are specilized heads in BERT model, that find syntactic relations. 
2. Discovered relation may diverge from whtat is provided in guidelines. For instance there are different from Universal Dependencies for english.
3. Averaging of multiple heads or each relation improves the results.

## Differences from Universal Dependencies for English
    1. instead copula relation we treat `to be` as predicate of a sentence E. g. `He is a runner`
    2. `expletive`  relations are treated as `subject`. E.g. in sentence `There are many ways` ‚ÄúThere‚Äù will be treated as subject.
    3. ~~Predicate ‚Üí Subject is more often retrieved than Subject ‚Üí Predicate.~~









----------


## Ideas üí° 


1. Probabilistic instead of ‚Äúhard‚Äù dependency relations obtained. Should be beneficial for use in structure aware models.
2. ~~Apart from head selection gold annotation is not used.  Error analysis could reveal some drawbacks of the base annotation.~~
3. With multilingual BERT the analysis can be repeated for other languages even with scarce annotated corpus.


----------
## Less supervision
1. Select heads by non syntactic features, e.g.:
    1. variability
    2. attention concentration below/above diagonal
    3. attention distance from a diagonal
2. Substitute POS information. EM optimization:
    
    $$\displaystyle\prod_{X\to Y}{P(Y=y_{dep}|X=x_{dep})P(X\to Y|Y=y_{dep})} \cdot P(X_{ROOT}=root)$$

Similar heads have the same function for many languages in multilingual Bert.
