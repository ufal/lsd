ADMINISTRATIVE AND FINAL CLAUSES
This Regulation shall determine the security gradings and the security measures to be applied to information acquired by the Community or communicated by Member States which is covered by Articles 24 and 25 of the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Community ( hereinafter called " the Treaty " ) .
Such information shall hereinafter be called : Euratom Classified Information ( " ECI " ) .
However , when a State communicates information covered by Article 25 , the Regulation shall apply only if the use to which the information is put falls within the scope of the Treaty .
Reports , data , documents , objects , reproducing media and matter relating to information as referred to in the first paragraph shall be treated as ECI .
Contracts , transactions or agreements concerned with activities coming within the scope of the Treaty which are concluded , extended or renewed between a Member State and a natural or legal person after the entry into force of this Regulation shall not be relied upon as a ground for not complying with the provisions of this Regulation .
Security measures which derive from contractual obligations put into effect prior to this Regulation may , however , be applied instead of the provisions of the Regulation for the period specified in the contract concerned .
Scope in relation to persons
The security measures laid down in this Regulation shall be applied to ECI and the instructions needed to ensure that these measures are observed shall be issued by :
( a ) institutions , committees , services and installations of the Community ;
( b ) Member States and their authorities ;
( c ) Joint Undertakings ;
( d ) persons and undertakings as defined in Article 196 of the Treaty .
Joint Undertakings
The Statutes of each Joint Undertaking shall determine whether that Joint Undertaking is to be treated , for the purposes of this Regulation , in the same way as the institutions , services and installations of the Community or as persons and undertakings as defined in Article 196 of the Treaty .
Provisions supplementing the Security Regulation
The rules for the protection of ECI laid down in this Regulation shall be treated as minimum requirements .
Where necessary , the Community and the Member States shall supplement the Security Regulation within their respective jurisdictions to take due account of local conditions and may strengthen it by means of appropriate provisions of their own provided , however , that they do not adversely affect the uniform treatment of ECI .
Security Bureau
Under the authority and responsibility of the Commission , the Security Bureau set up by the Commission shall :
( a ) co - ordinate and ensure the general application of security measures ;
( b ) supervise the application of those measures in the institutions , committees , services and installations of the Community ;
( c ) be empowered to have the application of the security measures for ECI as laid down in this Regulation verified in the territory of Member States by the national authorities and , if it considers this necessary , carry out such verification itself in collaboration with those authorities ;
( d ) propose any amendments it considers necessary for the application of this Regulation .
Bodies responsible for applying security measures in Member States
Each Member State shall appoint an official body to be responsible for applying or causing to be applied in the territory within its jurisdiction the security measures laid down in this Regulation .
Security Officers
In each institution , service and installation of the Community where ECI is prepared or kept , the Security Office shall appoint an official to be responsible for applying this Regulation ( hereinafter called " Security Officer " ) .
Authorities of Member States and all persons or undertakings as defined in Article 196 of the Treaty who prepare or have possession of ECI shall , with the approval of the official body responsible for security referred to in Article 7 , appoint an official to be responsible for applying this Regulation ( hereinafter called " Security Officer " ) .

Classification and declassification of ECI
Security gradings shall be applied only to the extent strictly necessary .
ECI shall be classified according to a scale of security gradings as follows :
Eura - Top Secret : where unauthorised disclosure of the information would have extremely serious consequences for the defence interests of one or more Member States ;
Eura - Secret : where unauthorised disclosure of the information would have serious consequences for the defence interests of one or more Member States ;
Eura - Confidential : where unauthorised disclosure of the information would be harmful to the defence interests of one or more Member States ;
Eura - Restricted : where unauthorised disclosure of the information would affect the defence interests of one or more Member States but where a lesser degree of security is required than in the case of documents classified as Eura - Confidential .
Authorities competent in respect of classification
The Commission shall classify information covered by Article 24 of Treaty :
( a ) provisionally , where it considers that disclosure is liable to harm the defence interests of one or more Member States ;
( b ) definitively , as soon as the Member States have made known the security grading they are requesting .
The highest grading so requested shall be applied .
The Commission shall notify the Member States accordingly .
The Commission shall establish and revise periodically , in collaboration with the competent authorities of the Member States , a non - exhaustive list of the categories of information to which a security grading should be applied .
The Commission shall notify both the competent institutions and the organs of the Community as well as the other Member States of the security grading required by the orginating State in respect of applications for patents or utility models covered by Article 25 of the Treaty .
The security grading applicable to a document relating to ECI shall be determined solely on the basis of the contents of the document in question and not on the basis of the grading of the ECI subject - matter to which it relates .
To avoid endangering the security of documents which come under Eura - Secret and Eura - Top Secret gradings , references to such documents shall be kept to a minimum and made in a way which shall disclose neither their contents nor their security gradings .

COUNCIL DIRECTIVE of 17 December 1974 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to cold - water meters ( 75 / 33 / EEC )
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES ,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community , and in particular Article 100 thereof ;
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission ;
Having regard to the Opinion of the European Parliament ( 1 ) ;
Having regard to the Opinion of the Economic and Social Committee ( 2 ) ;
Whereas in the Member States the construction and the methods of control of cold - water meters are subject to mandatory provisions which differ from one Member State to another and consequently hinder trade in such instruments ; whereas it is therefore necessary to approximate these provisions ;
Whereas Council Directive No 71 / 316 / EEC ( 3 ) of 26 July 1971 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to common provisions for both measuring instruments and methods of metrological control , as amended by the Act of Accession ( 4 ) , laid down the EEC pattern approval and EEC initial verification procedures ; whereas , in accordance with that Directive , the technical requirements for the design and functioning of cold - water meters should be laid down ; whereas such requirements must be met , and the controls must be carried out , and the appropriate signs and marks affixed , before these instruments can be freely imported , marketed and used ,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE :
This Directive shall apply to cold - water meters , which are integrating measuring instruments for continuously determining the volume of water ( and no other liquid ) passing through them , and which comprise a measuring device linked to an indicating device .
Water shall be considered to be " cold " when its temperature is in the range 0 º to 30 º C .
Cold - water meters which may bear the EEC marks and signs are described in the Annex to this Directive .
They shall be subject to EEC pattern approval and submitted to EEC initial verification .
No Member State may refuse , prohibit or restrict the placing on the market or entry into service of cold - water meters bearing the EEC pattern approval symbol and the EEC initial verification mark , on the grounds of their metrological properties .
Member States shall put into force the laws , regulations and administrative provisions needed in order to comply with this Directive within 18 months of its notification and shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof .
Member States shall ensure that the texts of the main provisions of national law which they adopt in the field covered by this Directive are communicated to the Commission .
This Directive is addressed to the Member States .
Done at Brussels , 17 December 1974 .
ANNEX
TERMINOLOGY AND DEFINITIONS
This Annex applies only to cold - water meters based on a direct mechanical process involving the use of volumetric chambers with mobile walls or the action of the velocity of the water on the rotation rate of a moving part ( turbine , impeller etc . . . ) .
The flowrate is the volume of water passing through the meter per unit of time , the volume being expressed in cubic metres or litres and the time in hours , minutes or seconds .
The volume delivered is the total volume of water which has passed through the meter in a given time .
The maximum flowrate , Qmax , is the highest flowrate at which the meter can function over limited periods without damage , and without exceeding the maximum permissible errors and the maximum permissible value for loss of pressure .
The nominal flowrate , Qn , is equal to half the maximum flowrate , Qmax .
It is expressed in cubic metres per hour and is used to designate the meter .
At the nominal flowrate , Qn , the meter should be able to function in normal use , i . e . , in continuous and intermittent operating conditions , without exceeding the maximum permissible errors .
The minimum flowrate , ( Qmin ) , is the flowrate above which the meter must not exceed the maximum permissible errors , and is fixed as a function of Qn .
The flowrate range of a water meter is bounded by the maximum and minimum flowrates , Qmax and Qmin .
It is divided into two regions , termed upper and lower , with different maximum permissible errors .
The transitional flowrate , Qt , is the flowrate which divides the upper and lower regions of the flow range and the rate at which the maximum permissible errors become discontinuous .
The maximum permissible error is the limit of the error permitted by this Directive for EEC pattern approval and EEC initial verification of a water meter .
Loss of pressure means the loss which is caused by the presence of the water meter in the conduit .
METROLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS
The maximum error permitted in the lower region , from Qmin inclusive to Qt non - inclusive , is ± 5 % .
The maximum error permitted in the upper region , from Qt inclusive to Qmax inclusive , is ± 2 % .
Metrological classes
Water meters are divided , according to the values of Qmin and Qt defined above , into the three metrological classes in the following table : % gt % PIC FILE = % quot % T0006670 % quot % % gt %
TECHNOLOGICAL CHARACTERISTICS
Construction - General provisions
The meters must be constructed in such a way as to :
( 1 ) give long service and guarantee proof against fraud ,
( 2 ) conform with the provisions of this Directive , under normal conditions of use .
Where meters may be subjected to an accidental reversal of flows they must be capable of withstanding it without any deterioration or change in their metrological properties , and at the same time should record such a reversal .
The water meter must be made of materials of adequate strength and stability for the purpose for which the water meter is to be used .
It must be constructed throughout of materials which are resistant to internal and normal external corrosion and if necessary be protected by some suitable surface treatment .
Water temperature variations within the working temperature range must not adversely affect the materials used in the construction of the water meter .
Soundness - pressure tightness
A meter must be able to withstand constantly - without defects in its functioning , leakage , seepage through the walls or permanent deformation - the continuous water pressure for which it is designed , termed the maximum operating pressure .
The minimum value for this pressure is 10 bars .
The purpose of this Directive is to fix limit values ( Annex I ) and guide values ( Annex II ) for sulphur dioxide and suspended particulates in the atmosphere and the conditions for their application in order to improve :
- the protection of human health ,
- the protection of the environment .
" Limit values " means :
- the concentrations of sulphur dioxide and suspended particulates considered simultaneously in accordance with Table A in Annex I , and
- the concentrations of suspended particulates considered separately in accordance with Table B in Annex I ,
which , in order to protect human health in particular , must not be exceeded throughout the territory of the Member States during specified periods and under the conditions laid down in the following Articles .
" Guide values " means the concentrations of sulphur dioxide and suspended particulates over specified periods which are given in Annex II and are intended to serve as :
- long - term precautions for health and the environment ,
- reference points for the establishment of specific schemes within zones determined by the Member States .
Member States shall take appropriate measures to ensure that as from 1 April 1983 the concentrations of sulphur dioxide and suspended particulates in the atmosphere are not greater than the limit values given in Annex I , without prejudice to the following provisions .
Where a Member State considers that there is a likelihood that , despite the measures taken , the concentrations of sulphur dioxide and suspended particulates in the atmosphere might , after 1 April 1983 , exceed in certain zones the limit values given in Annex I , it shall inform the Commission thereof before 1 October 1982 .
It shall at the same time forward to the Commission plans for the progressive improvement of the quality of the air in those zones .
These plans , drawn up on the basis of relevant information on the nature , origin and evolution of the pollution , shall describe in particular the measures taken or to be taken and the procedures implemented or to be implemented by the Member State concerned .
These measures and procedures must bring the concentrations of sulphur dioxide and suspended particulates in the atmosphere within these zones to values below or equal to the limit values given in Annex I as soon as possible and by 1 April 1993 at the latest .
In the zones in which the Member State concerned considers it necessary to limit or prevent a foreseeable increase in pollution by sulphur dioxide and suspended particulates in the wake of development , in particular urban or industrial development , the Member State shall , taking the guide values in Annex II as a reference point , fix values which must be lower than the limit values in Annex I .
In zones on its territory which the Member State concerned considers should be afforded special environmental protection , the Member State shall fix values which are generally lower than the guide values in Annex II .
Member States shall inform the Commission of the values , deadlines and timetables they have laid down for the zones referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 , and of any appropriate measures they have taken .
In addition to the provisions referred to in Article 3 ( 1 ) and Article 4 ( 1 ) , Member States shall , with the object of taking further precautions for the protection of health and the environment , endeavour to move towards the guide values in Annex II wherever the measured concentrations are higher than these values .
Member States shall establish measuring stations designed to supply the data necessary for the application of this Directive , in particular in zones where the limit values referred to in Article 3 ( 1 ) are likely to be approached or exceeded and in the zones referred to in Article 3 ( 2 ) ; the stations must be located at sites where pollution is thought to be greatest and where the measured concentrations are representative of local conditions .
Following the entry into force of this Directive , Member States shall inform the Commission , not later than six months after the end ( 31 March ) of the annual reference period , of instances in which the limit values laid down in Annex I have been exceeded and of the concentrations recorded .
They shall also notify the Commission , not later than one year after the end of the annual reference period , of the reasons for such instances and of the measures they have taken to avoid their recurrence .
In addition , Member States shall forward information to the Commission , at its request , on the concentrations of sulphur dioxide and suspended particulates in any zones they have designated pursuant to Article 4 ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .
The Commission shall each year publish a summary report on the application of this Directive .
Application of the measures taken pursuant to this Directive must not bring about a significant deterioration in the quality of the air where the level of pollution by sulphur dioxide and suspended particulates at the time of implementation of this Directive is low in relation to the limit values set out in Annex I .
For the purposes of applying this Directive , the Member States shall use either the reference methods of sampling and analysis referred to in Annex III or any other method of sampling and analysis in respect of which they demonstrate to the Commission at regular intervals :
- either that it ensures satisfactory correlation of results with those obtained using the reference method ;
- or that measurements taken in parallel with the reference method at a series of representative stations chosen in accordance with the requirements laid down in Article 6 show that there is a reasonably stable relationship between the results obtained using that method and those obtained using the reference method .
Without prejudice to the provisions of this Directive , a Member State may also use , pending the decision of the Council on the proposals from the Commission referred to in paragraph 4 , the sampling and analysis methods laid down in Annex IV and the values associated with these methods also laid down in Annex IV in substitution for the limit values set out in Annex I .
A Member State which decides to avail itself of the provisions of paragraph 2 must however take measurements in parallel at a series of representative measuring stations , chosen in accordance with the requirements of Article 6 , in order to verify the corresponding stringency of the limit values set out in Annex IV and Annex I .
The Commission shall , after five years , but within six years of the expiry of the limit of 24 months specified in Article 15 ( 1 ) , submit a report to the Council on the results of the parallel measurements carried out under paragraph 3 and shall , having regard in particular to these results and to the need to avoid discriminatory provisions , make proposals relating to paragraph 2 and Annex IV . In the report provided for in Article 8 the Commission will indicate whether it has noted instances in which the limit values fixed in Annex I have been exceeded to a significant extent on repeated occasions .
The Commission shall , in selected locations in the Member States and in cooperation with the latter , carry out studies on the sampling and analysis of sulphur dioxide , and of black smoke and suspended particulates .
These studies shall be designed in particular to promote the harmonization of methods of sampling and analysis of these pollutants .
Where Member States fix in border regions values for concentrations of sulphur dioxide and suspended particulates in the atmosphere in accordance with Article 4 ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , they shall hold prior consultations .
The Commission may attend such consultations .
Where the limit values given in Annex I or the values referred to in Article 4 ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , inasmuch as the latter values have been the subject of consultations in accordance with paragraph 1 , are or might be exceeded following significant pollution which originates or may have originated in another Member State , the Member States concerned shall hold consultations with a view to remedying the situation .
The Commission may attend such consultations .
The procedure laid down in Articles 13 and 14 for the adaptation on this Directive to technical progress shall cover the subsequent development of the reference methods of sampling and analysis referred to in Annex III .
This adaptation must not result in any direct or indirect modification of effective concentration values given in Annexes I and II .
For the purpose of Article 12 a Committee on the adaptation of this Directive to scientific and technical progress , hereinafter called " the Committee " , shall be set up ;
it shall consist of representatives of the Member States , with a Commission representative as chairman .
The Committee shall adopt its own rules of procedure .
Where the procedure laid down in this Article is invoked , the Committee shall be convened by the chairman , either on his own initiative or at the request of the representative of a Member State .
The Commission representative shall submit a draft of the measures to be taken to the Committee .
The Committee shall give its opinion on the draft within a time limit set by the chairman having regard to the urgency of the matter .
Decisions shall be taken by a majority of 41 votes , the votes of the Member States being weighted as provided in Article 148 ( 2 ) of the Treaty .
The chairman shall not vote .
The Commission shall adopt the proposed measures if they are consistent with the opinion of the Committee .
Where the proposed measures are not consistent with the opinion of the Committee , or if no opinion is delivered , the Commission shall without delay submit to the Council a proposal on the measures to be taken .
The Council shall decide by a qualified majority .
The purpose of this Directive is to :
- fix a limit value ( Annex I ) for nitrogen dioxide in the atmosphere specifically to help protect human beings against the effects of nitrogen dioxide in the environment ,
- lay down guide values ( Annex II ) for nitrogen dioxide in the atmosphere in order to improve the protection of human health and contribute to the long - term protection of the environment .
This Directive shall not apply to exposure at work or inside buildings .
For the purposes of this Directive :
- " limit value " means the concentration of nitrogen dioxide as defined in the table in Annex I which must not be exceeded throughout the territory of the Member States during specified periods and under the conditions laid down in the following Articles ,
- " guide values " means the concentrations of nitrogen dioxide as given in Annex II considered over specified periods and intended , in particular , to serve as reference points for the establishment of specific schemes within zones determined by the Member States .
Member States shall take the necessary measures to ensure that as from 1 July 1987 the concentrations of nitrogen dioxide in the atmosphere measured in accordance with Annex III are not greater than the limit value given in Annex I .
However , when in particular circumstances the nitrogen dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere in certain zones are likely , despite the measures taken , to exceed the limit value in Annex I after 1 July 1987 , the Member State concerned shall inform the Commission thereof before 1 July 1987 .
It shall forward plans for the gradual improvement of the quality of the air in these zones to the Commission as soon as possible .
These plans , drawn up on the basis of relevant information on the nature , origin and development of this pollution , shall describe , in particular , the measures taken or to be taken and the procedures implemented or to be implemented by the Member State concerned .
These measures and procedures must aim at reducing the nitrogen dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere within these zones to values not exceeding the limit value given in Annex I as rapidly as possible and by 1 January 1994 at the latest .
In the zones in which the Member State concerned considers it necessary to limit or prevent a foreseeable increase in pollution by nitrogen dioxide in the wake of urban or industrial development in particular , it may fix values lower than the limit value in Annex I .
In zones which the Member State concerned considers should be afforded special environmental protection , it may fix values which are generally lower than the guide values in Annex II .
Member States may , at any time , fix values more stringent than those laid down in this Directive .
Member States shall establish measuring stations to supply the data necessary for the application of this Directive in accordance with the specifications in Annex III , in particular in zones where the limit value is exceeded or likely to be exceeded and in the zones referred to in Article 4 .
Such stations may also measure concentrations of nitric oxide .
From 1 July 1987 Member States shall inform the Commission , not later than six months after the end ( 31 December ) of the annual reference period , of instances in which the limit value laid down in Annex I has been exceeded and of the concentrations recorded .
Member States shall also notify the Commission , not later than one year after the end of the annual reference period , of the reasons for such instances and of the measures they have taken to deal with them .
In addition , Member States shall inform the Commission , at its request , of :
- the concentrations they have measured ,
- the limit values , deadlines and timetables they have laid down ,
- any appropriate measures they have taken ,
concerning the zones referred to in Article 4 ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) .
This information must also be made available to the public .
The Commission shall publish periodically a summary report on the application of this Directive .
The application of the measures taken pursuant to this Directive must not lead to a significant deterioration in the quality of the air in zones , outside urban areas , where the level of pollution by nitrogen dioxide at the time of implementation of this Directive is low in relation to the limit value laid down in Annex I .
In applying this Directive , Member States shall use :
- either the reference method of analysis referred to in Annex IV ,
- or any other method of analysis which the Commission has been shown is equivalent to the reference method .
Where a Member State intends to fix , in a region near the border with one or more other Member States , values for concentrations of nitrogen dioxide in the atmosphere in accordance with Article 4 ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) , it shall hold prior consultations with the Member States concerned .
The Commission shall be informed and may attend such consultations .
Where the limit value given in Annex I or the values referred to in Article 4 ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) - provided that the latter values have been the subject of consultations in accordance with paragraph 1 - are or are likely to be exceeded following significant pollution which originates or may originate in another Member State , the Member States concerned shall hold consultations with a view to remedying the situation .
The Commission shall be informed and may attend such consultations .
The amendments necessary to adapt the specifications in Annex IV to technical progress shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure described in Article 14 .
These amendments shall not be such as to alter , directly or indirectly , the limit value laid down in Annex I .
For the purposes of Article 12 , a Committee on the Adaptation of this Directive to Scientific and Technical Progress , hereinafter called " the Committee " , shall be set up , composed of representatives of the Member States with a Commission representative as Chairman .
The Committee shall adopt its own rules of procedure .
Where the procedure laid down in this Article is to be followed , matters shall be referred to the Committee by its Chairman , either on his own initiative or at the request of the representative of a Member State .
The Commission representative shall submit a draft of the measures to be taken to the Committee .
The Committee shall give its opinion on the draft within a time limit set by the Chairman having regard to the urgency of the matter .
Decisions shall be taken by a majority of 45 votes , the votes of the Member States being weighted as provided in Article 148 ( 2 ) of the Treaty .
The Chairman shall not vote .
The Commission shall adopt the proposed measures if they are consistent with the opinion of the Committee .
Where the proposed measures are not consistent with the opinion of the Committee , or if no opinion is delivered , the Commission shall without delay submit to the Council a proposal on the measures to be taken .
The Council shall decide by a qualified majority .
If , within three months of the proposal being submitted to it , the Council has not acted , the proposed measures shall be adopted by the Commission .
Member States shall bring into force the laws , regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 1 January 1987 at the latest and shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof .
Member States shall communicate to the Commission the texts of the provisions of national law which they adopt in the field covered by this Directive .
This Directive is addressed to the Member States .
This Directive establishes minimum Community measures for the control of the diseases affecting bivalve molluscs referred to in this Directive .
For the purposes of this Directive , the definitions laid down in Article 2 of Directive 91 / 67 / EEC and Article 2 of Directive 91 / 492 / EEC ( 4 ) shall apply as necessary .
In addition , " observed abnormal mortality " shall mean sudden mortality affecting approximately 15 % of stocks and occurring over a short period between two inspections ( confirmed within 15 days ) .
In hatchery a mortality shall be considered abnormal when the farmer cannot obtain larvae during a period which included successive spawns from different broodstocks .
In nursery a mortality shall be considered abnormal when a sudden sizeable mortality occurs in a short time on a number of tubes .
Member States shall ensure that all farms rearing bivalve molluscs :
1 . are registered by the official service ; this registration must be kept constantly up to date ;
2 . keep a record of :
( a ) live bivalve molluscs entering the farm , containing all information relating to their delivery , their number or weight , their size and their origin ;
( b ) bivalve molluscs leaving the farm for reimmersion , containing all information relating to their dispatch , their number or weight , their size and destination ;
( c ) observed abnormal mortality .
This record , which shall be open to scrutiny by the official service at all times , on demand , shall be updated regularly and kept for four years .
Member States shall ensure that a monitoring and sampling programme is applied in bivalve mollusc farms , farming areas and harvested natural beds in order to observe whether there is an abnormal mortality and keep track of the health situation of stocks .
In addition , the official service may apply the above programme to purification centres and storage tanks which discharge water into the sea .
If , during application of this programme , any abnormal mortality is observed , or if the official service has information giving it reason to suspect the presence of diseases , the following measures shall be taken :
- a list shall be drawn up of the sites where the diseases referred to in Annex A , list II to Directive 91 / 67 / EEC are present , provided that such diseases are not the subject of a programme approved pursuant to the aforementioned Directive ,
- a list shall be drawn up of the sites at which abnormal mortality has been observed as a result of the presence of the diseases referred to in Annex D , or on which the official service has information giving it reason to suspect the presence of diseases ,
- monitoring of the evolution and geographical spread of the diseases referred to in the first and second indents .
The detailed rules for implementing this Article , and inter alia the rules to be applied for establishing the programme referred to in paragraph 1 , particularly as regards the frequency and timetable of monitoring , procedures for taking samples ( statistically representative volume ) and methods of diagnosis , shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure provided for in Article 10 .
Member States shall ensure that the suspected presence of any diseases referred to in Article 4 and any abnormal mortality rate observed in bivalve molluscs in farms , in farming areas or in harvested natural beds or in purification centres or storage tanks which discharge water into the sea is notified as soon as possible to the official service by the shellfish - farmers or any other person who has made such observations .
In the case referred to in paragraph 1 , the official service in the Member States shall ensure that :
( a ) samples are taken for examination in an approved laboratory ;
( b ) pending the result of the examination referred to in ( a ) , no molluscs leave the affected farm , farming area or harvested natural beds or purification centres or storage tanks which discharge water into the sea for relaying or reimmersion in another farm or in the aquatic environment , unless authorized by the official service .
If the examination referred to in paragraph 2 ( a ) fails to demonstrate the presence of a pathogen , the restrictions referred to in paragraph 2 ( b ) shall be lifted .
If the examination referred to in paragraph 2 shows the presence of a pathogen causing the observed abnormal mortality capable of being the cause of that mortality , or of a pathogen of one of the diseases referred to in Article 4 , an epizootic investigation must be carried out by the official service in order to determine the possible means of contamination and to investigate whether molluscs have left the farm , the farming area or the harvested natural beds for relaying or reimmersion elsewhere during the period preceding observation of the abnormal mortality .
If the epizootic investigation shows that the disease has been introduced into one or more farms , farming areas or harvested natural beds as a result inter alia of molluscs being moved , the provisions of paragraph 2 shall apply .
However , by way of derogation from Article 3 ( 1 ) ( c ) of Directive 91 / 67 / EEC , the official service may , within its territory , authorize the movement of live bivalve molluscs to other farms , farming areas or harvested natural beds which are infected with the same disease .
If necessary , further appropriate measures may be decided on in accordance with the procedure in Article 10 .
The official service shall ensure that the Commission and the other Member States are immediately informed , in accordance with the current Community procedures , of any cases of abnormal mortality rates observed involving a pathogen , of any measures taken to analyse and control the situation and of the cause of the mortality .
Sampling and laboratory testing for the determination of the cause of abnormal mortality of bivalve molluscs shall be carried out using the methods established in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 10 .
Member States shall ensure that in each Member State a national reference laboratory is designated , with facilities and expert personnel enabling it to carry out the testing referred to in paragraph 1 .
By way of derogation from paragraph 2 , Member States which do not have a national laboratory competent in the matter may use the services of a national laboratory with competence in the matter in another Member State .
The list of national reference laboratories for diseases of bivalve molluscs is set out in Annex C .
National reference laboratories shall cooperate with the Community reference laboratory referred to in Article 7 .
The Community reference laboratory for diseases of bivalve molluscs is indicated in Annex A .
Without prejudice to Decision 90 / 424 / EEC of 26 June 1990 ( 1 ) on expenditure in the veterinary field and in particular Article 28 thereof , the functions and duties of the laboratory referred to in paragraph 1 shall be those laid down in Annex B .
Commission experts may , to the extent necessary to ensure uniform application of this Directive , carry out on - the - spot checks .
In so doing , they may carry out random , non - discriminatory checks to ensure that the competent authority is monitoring compliance with the requirements of this Directive .
The Commission shall inform the Member States of the results of these checks .
The checks referred to in paragraph 1 shall be carried out in collaboration with the competent authority .
The Member State in whose territory the inspections are carried out shall provide the experts with any assistance they require to accomplish their task .
Detailed rules for the application of this Article shall be adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 10 .
Annex A shall be amended as necessary by the Council , acting by a qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission .
Annexes B , C and D may be amended as necessary in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 10 .
Where the procedure laid down in this Article is to be followed , matters shall be referred without delay to the Standing Veterinary Committee , ( hereinafter referred to as ' the Committee ' ) , set up by decision 68 / 361 / EEC ( 2 ) , by its Chairman , either on his own initiative or at the request of a Member State .
The representative of the Commission shall submit to the Committee a draft of the measures to be taken .
The Committee shall deliver its opinion on the draft within the time limit which the Chairman may lay down according to the urgency of the matter .
The opinion shall be delivered by the majority laid down in Article 148 ( 2 ) of the Treaty in the case of decisions which the Council is required to adopt on a proposal from the Commission .
The votes of the representatives of the Member States within the Committee shall be weighted in the manner set out in that Article .
The Chairman shall not vote .
If President Bush wants to be taken seriously in Latin America , he must bridge the divide between appearing concerned and actually being concerned about the fate of America 's southern neighbors .
The best place to start would be with Mexico , a victim of benign neglect since the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington last autumn .
Mexico is a bench - mark for how much the US is willing to do and not just say about a new sort of engagement with Latin America .
Last year , five tons of heroin was smuggled through the lands now overseen by the United Nations and NATO .
Interpol says that Albanian gangs now control 70 % of heroin trafficking in Germany , Austria , Switzerland and Scandinavia .
Cooperation over the last few years between the UN Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo ( UNMIK ) , the NATO - led multinational Kosova Force ( KFOR ) , and local governments - boosted by the arrival of a democratic government in Serbia - has cut down the number of terrorist attacks in Southern Serbia and Macedonia .
Calm will not return to the Balkans so long as the UN and NATO fail to destroy extremism 's base in Kosovo .
For the criminal / terrorist heart of the supposedly disbanded Kosovo Liberation Army continues to fortify its power and to expand into Macedonia , Southern Serbia and Montenegro .
" Greater Albania , " has not been forgotten .
The Commission 's decision on Latvia 's National Allocation Plan ( NAP ) for 2008 - 2012 left only 55 % of the CO2 emissions that Latvia requested .
Similarly , Estonia and Lithuania received only 52 - 53 % of their requested quotas .
Serious cuts were also made to other new EU members ' quotas , prompting Poland , the Czech Republic , and Slovakia , as well as Latvia , to launch legal challenges .
To be sure , the arrest of General Ante Gotovina , adored by many Croats as a hero , but responsible for the brutal expulsion of a quarter - million Serbs from Croatia and north - west Bosnia – the biggest ethnic cleansing in Europe since WWII – improves the ICTY 's standing .
But Milosevic 's Croatian and Bosniak counterparts , Franjo Tudjman and Alija Izetbegovic , respectively , remained unindicted when they died .
So , too , the main commanders of the Kosovo Liberation Army ( UCK ) .
Ramush Haradinaj , the prime minister of Kosovo , was accused but later released from detention .
I have always been convinced that Milosevic should have been put on trial in Belgrade .
After all , Milosevic 's critics and political rivals such as the journalist Slavko Curuvija and Milosevic 's former mentor , Ivan Stambolic , were assasinated by Serb police agents , who also tried three times to murder the opposition leader Vuk Draskovic .
The release of Alan Greenspan 's ghostwritten memoirs The Age of Turbulence has elicited charges that he was not such a great central banker after all .
Stan Collender of National Journal sees the fingerprints of the White House on these attacks : Greenspan is harshly critical of George W . Bush 's administration , after all , and to attack the credibility of Republican ex - policymakers who are critical of Bush is standard counterpunching for it .
But what is one to make of the criticisms of Greenspan 's tenure at the Federal Reserve ?
There was little he could do in Kosovo or the Congo .
The years of John Paul II 's papacy have not actually been a time in which " soft power " could achieve a great deal anywhere , so that Stalin 's famous question , " How many divisions has the Pope ? , " remained topical .
This was all the more relevant to the extent that Pope John Paul II is not enamored with the United States .
We saw the consequences of that gap in Afghanistan .
Article 5 of the NATO Treaty was invoked as if the Twin Towers attack was an attack on the whole alliance .
Many expected that America would call for a collective NATO response .
BRUSSELS : Joschka Fischer , Germany 's foreign minister , set the cat among the pigeons when he laid out his vision of a federalist European Union .
In Britain , where the idea of European federalism has never been popular , it was predictable that the Euro - sceptic newspaper The Times would denounce Mr Fischer 's ideas .
But even in France , traditionally committed to its partnership with Germany , he raised a small storm , most sensationally when Jean - Pierre Chevčnement , the French Interior Minister , responded with the bizarre claim that the Germans had not fully recovered from their Nazi past .
Last year , Romano Prodi , President of the European Commission and a former prime minister of Italy , made it clear that he believed enlargement would require radical constitutional reform of the Union .
So did a committee of " Three Wise Men " , led by Jean - Luc Dehaene , former Belgian prime minister .
This year , the case for radical constitutional reform of the EU was argued by Valery Giscard d ' Estaing , the former French President , and Helmut Schmidt , a former German Chancellor ; and also by Jacques Delors , a former President of the Commission .
Under Angela Merkel 's leadership , for example , Germany 's Christian Democrats are increasingly flirting with xenophobia .
In Italy , Silvio Berlusconi 's government also appears tainted with right - wing populism and xenophobia .
He , like William Hague and George W Bush , is promising to slash taxes .
Across Europe , it is not only British Prime Minister Tony Blair who is accused of " presidentialism " nowadays .
German Chancellor Gerhard Schröder faces the same charge in the current German election campaign .
Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy , indeed , does not even like being called Prime Minister .
In so far as the European Union is a " single market , " it is represented by the Trade Commissioner , Pascal Lamy .
If the issue is competition , Commissioner Mario Monti represents Europe , stridently so , as Americans have learned to their surprise .
But as soon as we move to wider issues of foreign and defense policy , Xavier Solana , the High Representative of the EU Council of Ministers , may be at the telephone number that Henry Kissinger famously could never find in Brussels when he wanted to " speak to Europe " in his day , but Solana is hardly in a position to speak for " Europe " in important matters today .
The opposition CDU leader , Angela Merkel , has linked its program to the ambitious ideas of an outsider , former Constitutional Court judge Paul Kirchhof , seeking a dramatic simplification of the tax system .
In international affairs , Merkel is more skeptical about European enlargement , notably to include Turkey , than Schröder .
Merkel , an East German by background , is also more cautious in her approach to Russia .
If Berezovsky 's punishment is more apparent than real , Berezovsky too will say nothing .
Removing Berezovsky would also allow Putin to establish direct control over Berezovsky 's media empire – another boost to his personal power .
What 's good for Putin may not be good for Russia .
As long as Hamas and Syria are left out of the United States - led peace process , they are condemned to Iran 's orbit .
However , Saudi Arabia 's willingness to participate in the conference might come with a price too high for Israel to pay : an endorsement of the Saudi peace initiative .
This is the reason Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was cautious in her reaction to the Saudis ' ambiguous acceptance of their invitation to attend the conference .
The Syria - Iran - Hamas - Hezbollah axis would be emboldened in its challenge to American leadership in the region , and , with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas humbled and defeated , a third Intifada would be a likely scenario .
It is therefore vitally important to take Syria , an ally of Iran and the patron of spoilers such as Hamas and Hezbollah , out of the war equation .
But this requires that both Israel and the United States change course .
Last year , Russia 's Patriarch Aleksei gave his blessing to a visit to Moscow by the Catholic girls ' choir of the Saint Danilov monastery .
Soon after , and more importantly , the Patriarch raised the level of Orthodoxy 's representation at an ecumenical prayer called by Pope John Paul II in Assisi on January 24 th .
This was to be followed by a visit to Moscow by a senior Vatican cleric , Cardinal Walter Kasper , President of the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity and the man who helped organize last year 's papal visits to Ukraine , Kazakhstan and Armenia .
As a Frenchman , I cannot wait for the next World Cup match between France and Germany .
But I want France to avenge its defeat at the last World Cup in Seville , not its defeat at Verdun .
Pascal Boniface is Director of the Institute for International and Strategic Relations ( IRIS ) , Paris .
From Khrushchev onward , Moscow 's rulers eyed the Vatican suspiciously but not without interest .
Kremlin leaders instinctively understood the benefits of normalising relations with the Holy See for Soviet propaganda and foreign policy , and meetings between the Pope and Andrei Gromyko and Nikolai Podgorny did take place .
Not until 1989 , however , did Mikhail Gorbachev dare establish official relations with the Vatican , inviting Pope John Paul II to visit the Soviet Union .
Indeed , Brown , for whom America remains " Britain 's most important bilateral relationship , " recently blocked his foreign secretary , David Miliband , from delivering a speech that he considered excessively pro - Europe .
But such uncertainty , common in times of transition , should not overshadow what the end of the Blair - Bush era in Britain holds in store .
Unilateralism and pre - emptive wars are to be replaced by what Brown defines as " an agenda for a hard - headed internationalism , " based on cooperation with multilateral agencies and alliances – the United Nations , NATO , the European Union , and the British Commonwealth .
A democracy that produces governments led by Hamas , Hezbollah , or the Muslim Brotherhood is inevitably bound to be anti - Western and opposed to an American - inspired " peace process " with Israel .
Syria has already sought to assure regime continuity through quasi - monarchic hereditary succession with the move from Hafez al - Assad to his son Bashar .
There are indications that Egypt might follow suit , with Hosni Mubarak 's son , Gamal , taking over .
But prying Syria from Iran 's embrace means , eventually , reopening the Golan Heights question .
A deal with Syria is not impossible , given the ambiguities in Assad 's position .
On the Israeli / American side , it would include recognition that Syria has security interests in Lebanon .
Today 's difficulties in the United States have exacted a heavy toll on growth in Latin America .
Mexico , with most of its exports destined for North America , is now in recession .
Thus , growth in Asia and Latin America depends not only on sound domestic policies , but also on what happens elsewhere .
Germany and France were against meeting Saddam Hussein with military force , but had no alternative for getting rid of the butcher of Baghdad .
" What was the European answer to the problem of Saddam Hussein ? " asked Senator Joe Biden in a panel discussion at the recent Davos forum .
Biden is a Democrat and strong critic of President Bush .
Once President Valéry Giscard d ' Estaing and Federal Chancellor Helmut Schmidt made the joint Franco German proposal for the Economic and Monetary Union ( EMU ) , both Belgium and the Netherlands worked together to achieve that common goal .
Along with Luxembourg , they were an important factor in creating EMU .
In 1991 , when the Netherlands held the European presidency , Belgium supported its far - reaching draft for a treaty of European Union .
WASHINGTON , DC : I have no personal opinion on the virtues of Caio Koch - Weiser , Germany 's candidate to head the International Monetary Fund .
But dithering over Michel Camdessus 's replacement ought to stop .
Stanley Fischer , a brilliant , experienced economist will lead the Fund very well in the interim .
But Kennedy was anxious about the consequences of having Soviet missiles in Cuba on Berlin .
Nuclear pressures from Cuba would have made defense of Berlin more difficult , which was part of Khrushchev 's strategy .
In the end , " the Berlin Crisis was solved through the outcome of the Cuban Missile Crisis , " the historian Ernest May argued .
And Kosovo 's Albanian population is clamoring for independence , while Serbia tries to postpone a decision by blocking action in the Security Council .
Similarly , any move by Bosnia 's Serb Republic to secede could incite instability there .
Serbia , which traded violent nationalism for nonviolent nationalism when Slobodan Milosevic was overthrown eight years ago , has done all it can to impede resolution of these issues , with strong support from Vladimir Putin 's Russia .
Serbia wants as much independence as possible for the Serb Republic , while asserting its own sovereignty over Kosovo .
Serbs governed only by Serbs on their own territory is still Serbia 's goal .
The United States and the European Union are committed to a different vision : democratic transition and integration of all of the Balkans into NATO and eventually the EU .
But they have been reluctant to impose conditions on Serbia , for fear of bringing even more radical nationalists to power .
In Kosovo , now that a last - ditch round of negotiations has concluded with a report to the UN Secretary General , the US and the EU should agree to recognize Kosovo 's independence , provided the Kosovars agree to implement the plan submitted by Finnish mediator Marti Ahtisaari .
The Ahtisaari plan provides ample protection for Serbs and an international presence in Kosovo – which the US and the EU will need to deploy even without a new Security Council resolution – to ensure implementation .
Ironically , Serbia 's resistance to the Ahtisaari plan undermines protection for Kosovo 's Serbs and increases the risk that they will be mistreated .
It worked against Libya , leading Muammar Khadafi in the late 1990 's to stop sponsoring terrorism , turn over the Lockerbie bombers for trial , and pay compensation to British and French victims of Libyan - sponsored terrorism .
Claims that he abandoned his nuclear program in response to the US - led invasion of Iraq have been refuted by Flynt Leverett , director for Middle Eastern affairs at the US National Security Council from 2002 to 2003 .
According to Leverett , Khadafi 's decision predated the invasion and was a response to an explicit quid - pro - quo to end international sanctions against Libya .
Bush 's actual words were these : " The British government has learned that Saddam Hussein recently sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa . "
Bush 's statement took this form because the CIA objected to the original version , which flatly stated that Saddam Hussein had sought to buy uranium from Africa .
The White House staff member who discussed it with the CIA then suggested changing the sentence so that it stated that the British reported that Saddam Hussein had sought to buy uranium from Africa .
I was taken aback by his scathing , virulent remarks about Prime Minister Viktor Yushchenko and former Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Timoshenko .

Since the Kremlin interrupted energy supplies to the Baltic states in 1990 in a futile attempt to stifle their independence movements , it has continued to use pipeline politics against countries such as Poland , Latvia , and Lithuania – all new EU members .
Since January 2006 , Moscow has negotiated separate deals with energy companies from Germany , France , Italy , Hungary , Serbia , Slovakia , and Denmark that could undercut Europe 's efforts to build additional pipelines aimed at bypassing Russia 's near monopoly of supplies from Central Asia .
It initially appeared that Germany under Chancellor Angela Merkel would be more sensitive to the energy security of Central and Eastern Europe .
Joseph E . Stiglitz is Professor of economics and finance at Columbia University and was the 2001 Nobel laureate in Economics .
Previously , he was Chairman of President Clinton 's Council of Economic Advisers , and Chief Economist and Senior Vice President of the World Bank .
Western governments were much more prepared to help Poland than they were to help Russia .
For example , Poland received a partial cancellation of its debts ; Russia did not .
Poland received early help from the West in stabilizing its currency ; Russia did not .
Is Buffett a victim of the " deception " that Adam Smith described , and that Kahneman and his colleagues have studied in more depth ?
Coincidentally , Kahneman 's article appeared the same week that Buffett announced the largest philanthropic donation in US history – $ 30 billion to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and another $ 7 billion to other charitable foundations .
Even when the donations made by Andrew Carnegie and John D . Rockefeller are adjusted for inflation , Buffett 's is greater .
Aleksander Smolar is President of the Stefan Batory Foundation , Warsaw , and Senior Researcher at the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique , Paris .

How Corrupt are US Capital Markets ?
Joseph Stiglitz is a Nobel laureate in economics .
Similar situations exist in Europe and East Asia .
European multinational firms invest heavily in low - wage countries such as Poland , Hungary , the Czech Republic , which are on the border of Western Europe , but not much in Romania , Ukraine , or Russia , which are farther away .
They invest in North African countries such as nearby Tunisia and Egypt but not much in Sub - Saharan Africa .
Thus , even though Africa has a profound crisis of disease , thousands of African doctors migrate to the US , Europe , and the Middle East in search of decent living standards .
Here , globalization may add to Africa 's crisis .
For poor and remote parts of the world - Sub - Saharan Africa , the Andean countries of Latin America , landlocked Central Asia , and parts of Southeast Asia - economic crisis is intensifying .
Will Cancun Promote or Undermine Development ?
Prostitution is illegal in most of the US , including Washington DC , and this could be one reason why Tobias had to resign .
But when New Jersey Governor John Corzine was involved in a serious road accident last month , it became known that he violated his own state 's law by not wearing his seat belt .
By any sensible measure , Corzine 's violation of the law was more serious than that of Tobias .
The vaunted New York Times ran a single story of 770 words on page 8 of the paper ( October 29 ) .
The Times reporter apparently did not interview a single Bush administration or US military official .
No follow - up stories or editorials appeared , and no New York Times reporters assessed the story on the ground .
Meanwhile , Saudi Arabia is pursing a different path .
In a February summit in Mecca between Abbas and Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal , the Saudi government worked out an agreement between Hamas and Fatah , which have been clashing violently , to form a national unity government .
According to the Mecca accord , Hamas agreed " to respect international resolutions and the agreements [ with Israel ] signed by the Palestinian Liberation Organization , " including the Oslo Accords .
After the terrorist attacks on the US of September 2001 , it wanted to withdraw troops from Saudi Arabia , and it presumably chose Iraq as its new long - term base of operation .
This , I believe , is why America is so opposed to a quick transfer of sovereignty to Iraqis .
A truly sovereign Iraq might well tell the US to withdraw from the country .
Instead , conflict broke out between Hamas and Fatah , leading to Fatah 's collapse and desperate flight from Gaza .
In a near - parody of external interventions , the US and Israel encouraged President Mahmoud Abbas of Fatah to dismiss the Hamas - led government , and to declare a new Fatah - led government in the West Bank .
Gaza is now under Hamas control , and the West Bank is perhaps under nobody 's control .
According to United Nations figures , in 2002 per capita emissions of greenhouse gases in the US were 16 times higher than in India , 60 times higher than in Bangladesh , and more than 200 times higher than in Ethiopia , Mali , or Chad .
Other developed nations with emissions close to those of the US include Australia , Canada , and Luxembourg .
Russia , Germany , Britain , Italy , France , and Spain all have levels between a half and a quarter that of the US .

A trade agreement such as this puts US and Central American workers in the same labor market .
If the whip is cracked in Tegucigalpa today , workers in Charlotte will feel it tomorrow .
If Salvadorans ' wages are squeezed , they wo n't be buying many products made in Los Angeles — unless , of course , they wind up moving there .
Yet we know from a range of evidence that this is what was on Bush 's mind when his government shifted its focus from the search for Osama bin Laden to fighting a war in Iraq .
The overthrow of Saddam was the longstanding pet idea of the neoconservative Project for a New American Century , which was already arguing in the 1990 's that Saddam was likely to achieve a stranglehold over " a significant proportion of the world 's oil supplies . "
Vice President Dick Cheney reiterated these fears in the run - up to the Iraq War , claiming that Saddam Hussein was building a massive arsenal of weapons of mass destruction to " take control of a great portion of the world 's energy supplies . "
In Britain , for example , Tony Blair articulates a vision of " a nation of savers and asset - holders . "
His plans have been called " asset - based policies , " a term that has grown in popularity since Michael Sherraden 's 1991 book Assets and the Poor : A New American Welfare Policy .
In the United States , President George W . Bush calls his dream the " ownership society . "
His grandfather , Wilhelm I , had presided over Prussia 's military victories , which enabled Bismarck to create the unified Reich in 1871 .
Within two years , Wilhelm II dismissed Bismarck .
Wilhelm II became the leader of a country on the cusp of European mastery .
When Mahmoud Abbas was elected president of the Palestinian Authority , Israel should have gone out of its way to strengthen him and his reformist team .
When Israel withdrew from Gaza the former head of the World Bank , James Wolfensohn , negotiated a six - point plan on behalf of the Quartet for the Middle East ( Russia , the United States , the European Union and the United Nations ) .
It included opening crossings between Gaza and the West Bank , an airport and seaport in Gaza , opening the border with Egypt , and transferring the greenhouses abandoned by Israeli settlers into Arab hands .
The Northern Alliance ruled a broad swath of Afghanistan 's far north for several years after the Taliban gained control of the rest of the country in 1996 .
Its Uzbek leader , Rashid Dostum , unleashed on his headquarters city , Mazar - I - Sharif , a wave of craven brutality and human rights abuses that bear comparison with the Taliban 's worst activities .
The Taliban 's cold - blooded massacre of more than a hundred Shiia Afghans followed close on the heels of a similar massacre of Taliban supporters by the Northern Alliance .
Like the Taliban , the Northern Alliance has aided and abetted terrorists .
One of only three terrorist groups singled out by President Bush in his address to Congress after the New York attacks was the " Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan , " now renamed the " Islamic Party of Turkistan . "
In two successive years several thousand armed guerrillas from the IMU crossed from northern Afghanistan via Tajikistan into Kyrgyzstan , Kazakstan , and Uzbekistan to foment insurrection .
Lee M . Silver is a professor of molecular biology and public policy at Princeton University .

Tung Chee Hwa , Hong Kong 's leader , insists that the " one country , two systems " scheme devised by Deng Xiaoping works perfectly .
The Financial Secretary , Anthony Leung , last year boasted that Hong Kong would become Asia 's " Manhattan Plus . "
Chief Secretary Sir Donal Tsang calls negative assessments of the territory the product of second - rate minds .
We are building a stronger relationship with the broader Middle East .
Already , the Alliance is developing a deeper political dialogue and more practical cooperation with the countries of North Africa , Israel and Jordan , and opening up a discussion with the Gulf States .
When Dr . Rice made her first visit as Secretary of State to NATO headquarters two weeks ago , Alliance Foreign Ministers had a discussion about the Middle East Peace Process .
For example , Murat Kurnaz , a German - born Turkish man , was held in Guantánamo for four years before being released last August .
The case of Khaled el - Masri , a German citizen of Lebanese descent , appears to be another of these errors .
Seized by the CIA in Macedonia , he was taken to Afghanistan and interrogated for five months before being released without charge .
Debate over Iraq dominated international diplomacy , and took up almost the entire UN agenda .
The war in Iraq cost countless innocent lives , such as when the UN headquarters in Baghdad was bombed .
At the same time , Bush 's emphasis on a one - dimensional , militarized approach to global problems has fueled unrest and instability throughout the Islamic world , leading to increased terrorism in Turkey , North Africa , Saudi Arabia , and Southeast Asia .
They advocated the overthrow of Saddam Hussein even before Bush was elected and won him to their cause after September 11 .
The invasion of Afghanistan could be justified on the grounds that the Taliban provided Bin Laden and Al Qaeda with a secure training ground .
Invading Iraq could not be similarly justified .
According to the Johns Hopkins University Comparative Nonprofit Sector Project , headed by Lester Salamon , the US leads major countries in private contributions to nonprofits .
Excluding donations to churches , such contributions amount to 1 % of GDP in the U . S . , which is six times higher than in Germany or Japan , and 30 times higher than in Mexico .
However , 1 % of GDP is still not a very big number , and the Gates Foundation , with about $ 60 billion after Buffett 's bequest , now accounts for a substantial share of the total .
Great Britain has made the Millennium Development Goals , and hence the IFF , the centerpiece of the G - 8 Summit , which will be held in Scotland next July .
French President Jacques Chirac has joined Blair and Brown in a bold call for rich countries to honor their promises to the poor .
The richest countries - the US , Germany , and Japan - must join this vital initiative .
The movement started a few years ago with the Publish What You Pay campaign , which urged oil and mining companies to disclose payments to governments .
In response , the British government launched the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative ( EITI ) .
Yesterday , three years into the process , the UK convened an important EITI conference in London attended by representatives of governments , business , and civil society .
Furthermore , we welcomed the interest shown by Russia and Ukraine in contributing to " Active Endeavor , " our anti - terrorist naval operation in the Mediterranean , as another sign of the growing strategic value of our partnership with these countries .
Finally , the Mediterranean and the broader Middle East .
NATO decided in Istanbul to reach out to new regions of strategic importance , in particular the broader Middle East .
All NATO allies and EU members want the US to remain committed to Europe 's future , to take the lead elsewhere in meeting security needs on which all agree , and to admit Europe into its strategic confidence .
That now requires supporting the EU 's deep involvement in Afghanistan as its key contribution to repairing and reforming the Atlantic Alliance .
Robert E . Hunter , US ambassador to NATO from 1993 to 1998 , is a senior adviser at the RAND Corporation , a nonprofit research organization .
Obaidullah 's capture – carried out reluctantly – underscores the Pakistan military 's ambiguous relationship with the Taliban .
Despite more than 700 Pakistani combat deaths , many in Musharraf 's army wish to retain the Taliban as quasi - allies who – when the Americans leave Afghanistan someday – will give Pakistan the " strategic depth " it needs against India .
Thus , to the chagrin of Afghanistan 's president , Hamid Karzai , Quetta remains a hub of Taliban opposition to his regime .
The mullahs , on the other hand , consider Musharraf an agent of the great Satan , America , and thus a traitor to Islam .
Nevertheless , Musharraf 's men have skillfully fractured the main Islamic opposition party , Muttahida Majlis - e - Amal ( MMA ) , with bribes , blackmail , and internal dissension fomented by agent provocateurs .
As part of the trade - off , terrorist leaders who are officially under house arrest – like Maulana Masood Azhar and Hafiz Saeed – remain able to open offices , address rallies , and preach jihad freely .
California long ago overtook New York as the most populous US state .
British Columbia plays an increasingly important role in Canada .

On February 5 th Colin Powell will present America 's case against Iraq to the UN Security Council .
His appearance will come a week after Hans Blix and Mohammed al - Baradei - - the chiefs of the UN inspectors - - demonstrated their inability to fulfill their mandate .
Khidhir Hamza , a former advisor to the Iraqi Atomic Energy Organization and former Director of Iraq 's Nuclear Weapons Program , explains how and why the UN inspections failed .
Great Britain and France will resist being replaced by a single EU seat , while making Germany a permanent member would only exacerbate the problem of Europe 's relative over - representation .
Pakistan would object to adding India to the Security Council ; Argentina , Chile , and Mexico to adding Brazil ; Nigeria to South Africa ( and vice - versa ) ; and several countries , including China , Indonesia , and South Korea , might resist creating a permanent seat for Japan .
In Bucharest recently , I was discussing the oversight role of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( OSCE ) in my country , Albania , with an expert from that body .
He was surprised to learn that the number of OSCE employees in Albania is equal to that of the entire staff of the OSCE 's Vienna headquarters .
The sheer scale of the OSCE 's operations in Albania is not what troubles me .
In 1990 , Europeans and Americans joined forces to reverse Iraq 's invasion and occupation of Kuwait .
Later in the decade , Europeans and Americans combined to stop ethnic conflict in Bosnia and Kosovo .
Europeans and Americans also worked to enlarge NATO and collaborated against terrorism in Afghanistan .
The point is not that Berlin should humbly accept whatever Washington says .
But it is Berlin that has to do the first step towards resuming dialogue with Washington after Schröder slammed the door .
Secondly , Berlin will have to reconnect with Paris .
Responses to America 's call for democracy in the Middle East have been tepid at best .
Arab governments feel provoked by President George W . Bush , particularly as he announced his initiative with little regional consultation .
Seeking to pre - empt American action , Egypt backed a counter - proposal , the Alexandria Declaration , at an Arab League summit last May , and followed this with President Hosni Mubarak 's recent announcement that he will allow opposition candidates to challenge him for the presidency .
So far , it appears as though the West will back Ilham over the opposition .
Former US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright , the president of the European Parliamentary Assembly , Rene Van der Linden , and US Deputy Secretary of State for global affairs Paula Dopryansky have all visited Baku recently .
As US foreign - policy doyen Zbigniew Brzezinski put it in an interview with a German radio station , " The majority of Azeris actually support President Ilham Aliyev .
Moreover , financial and human resources for military affairs are scarce and cannot be duplicated , while France and Britain want to restart the Saint - Malo process of bilateral defense efforts launched nearly ten years ago .
As a result , for the sake of Europe , France must move closer to the Alliance .
Sarkozy has also fully integrated into France 's approach to Europe a reckoning with the new balance of power within the European Union following the accession of Eastern European states .
Since the English Premier League was started in 1992 , only one championship was not won by Manchester United , Arsenal , or Chelsea .
In Italy , all but two Serie A championships since 1991 have been won by either Juventus or AC Milan .
In Spain , all but three championships since 1985 have been won by either Real Madrid or Barcelona .
The postwar architecture of German foreign policy has been made up of several bridges - - to the United States , to France , to Britain , to smaller EU member states , to Central and Eastern Europe , and to Russia .
The German way of diplomacy consisted of avoiding hard choices between Paris and Washington , Moscow and Warsaw , the EU and NATO , big neighbors and small ones .
If a choice had to be made , Germany gave America priority over France .

Many Muslims still condemn the founder of modern Turkey , Mustafa Kamal , because he tried to modernize his country .
But would Turkey be Muslim today without Ataturk ?
Mustafa Kamal 's clear - sightedness saved Islam in Turkey and saved Turkey for Islam .
Indeed , under Chirac , France appears increasingly arrogant , a nation convinced of the righteousness of its views and the universality of its model - the very charges so often levelled against George W . Bush 's America .
Chirac compounded his errors over Iraq in his approach to the new European Commission .
On the old commission headed by Romano Prodi , France was powerfully represented , with Pascal Lamy holding the trade portfolio .
Imagine how American managers would react to consultants arriving from Ghana with their " best practice " : " It worked in Accra , so it is bound to work in New York ! "
Of course , there is a prominent example of just that : Kofi Annan , under whose stewardship the UN has undergone a remarkable improvement .
And a key member of the Alliance , Turkey , may be about to embark in a dangerous military adventure in Kurdish northern Iraq .
Second , one cannot speak of NATO without noting that the Alliance 's twin pillars – Europe and the US – are not in great shape .
If Europe is " flat , " one reason is Sarkozy .
The difficult personal chemistry he has with German Chancellor Angela Merkel is reinforced by his constant attacks on the European Central Bank and its president , Jean - Claude Trichet .
One cannot simultaneously defend the Alliance in the name of Europe and weaken Europe with fits of populism and economic nationalism .
Europe 's three key new leaders – Britain 's Gordon Brown , Merkel , and Sarkozy – all belong to a generation that is no longer emotionally moved by the project of European integration .
Russia can now aim for a position in Europe that resembles the current partnership between the EU and Norway .
This scenario will become even more plausible following Russia 's admission to the WTO .
Russia does not need to join the EU to create institutions worthy of Europe .
What will it mean for the Union if it divides Europe into have and have not countries .
Kalman Mizsei , UN Assistant Secretary General and UN Development Program Director for Europe and the CIS , dissects these questions .
After its landmark expansion eastwards , the European Union will be understandably preoccupied with absorbing its new members and with negotiating with the applicants already in line to join : Romania , Bulgaria , Croatia , and possibly Turkey .
But the EU 's next challenge will be its new frontier : the former Soviet bloc nations - Serbia , Belarus , Ukraine , and of course Russia - which lie restlessly along the EU 's new eastern border .
This mattered less when these nations were separated by " buffer states " such as Poland , Slovakia and Hungary .
Neither EU incumbents nor aspirants paid much attention to Europe 's eastern and southern states during the accession process : current EU members were fixated on the aspirants , while the aspirants were fixated on Brussels .
The country can no longer play the role of transatlantic mediator between France and America .
It can forget about US support in its campaign to gain a permanent seat in the UN Security Council .
Instead of forging a " third way " for Europe 's left with British Prime Minister Tony Blair , Chancellor Gerhard Schröder needs Blair to plead his case with President George W . Bush , who feels personally betrayed by the Chancellor 's conduct in the run - up to the war .
So , with Baghdad 's fall , Schröder began to send conciliatory signals to Washington and London .
Schröder implicitly began to welcome regime change in Iraq .
During a Franco - German - Russian summit in St . Petersburg , he explicitly refrained from criticizing the US and Britain .
Moreover , both candidates embody continuity – with Chirac 's Gaullist side for Sarkozy and with François Mitterrand for Royal – as much as rupture .
Royal openly claims Mitterand 's legacy as she searches for legitimacy , while Sarkozy 's rejection of Chirac 's legacy has more to do with form than substance .
To a large extent , Sarkozy can be seen as Chirac with more , whereas Royal is clearly Mitterrand with less .
Of course , Sarkozy and German Chancellor Angela Merkel will not reproduce the special alliances of Helmut Schmidt and Valéry Giscard d ' Estaing , or François Mitterrand and Helmut Kohl .
But the future of Europe will once more depend largely on the governments in Berlin and Paris .
That said , Sarkozy 's victory will not make a huge difference for the world beyond Europe .
Like other democratic leaders , he might consider working in the private - sector , like Gerhard Schröder , or , better yet , write books and help Tsunami victims , like Bill Clinton or become an environmentalist , like Mikhail Gorbachev .
Nina Khrushcheva teaches international affairs at The New School in New York , and is currently a visiting fellow at the Institute for Human Sciences in Vienna .
Stalin 's " friendship , " of course , sent Mandelstam to his grave , and Pasternak , Shostakovich , and Bulgakov all found themselves isolated .
Again and again Josef Vissarionovich would repeatedly telephone Bulgakov after viewing the film version of his novel " The White Guard " in his favorite Moscow Art Theater ( MkhAT ) , to express his admiration .
" Mikhail Afanasievich , Stalin speaking , " would come the voice down the receiver , freezing the author in terror .
For Ernest Paul McCarver , an adult with the mind of a ten - year - old , whether and how President Bush reconciles his contradictory statements may well be a matter of life or death .
Harold Hongju Koh is Professor of international law at Yale University and former U . S . Assistant Secretary of State .
He is counsel for the diplomats in the case of " McCarver v . North Carolina . "
If he is well briefed for his summit in Moscow and Saint Petersburg , President Bush should discount Donne 's wisdom .
For within Russia , President Putin does appear to be an isolated island , at least among the Russian elite who have singularly failed to embrace his decision to anchor Russia firmly to the West .
American troops , they complain , are on the ground in the former Soviet republics of Georgia , Kyrgizstan , Tadjikistan , and Uzbelistan .
WARSAW : Everywhere in Europe , traditional right wing parties are in crisis .
Britain 's Tories appear on a suicidal march to isolating themselves in an imaginary little England .
A civil war grips the French right , with a Euro MP grandson of Charles de Gaulle abandoning the Gaullists to join Jean - Marie Le Pen 's National Front .
Whether or not the war in Lebanon has helped or hurt the Palestinians is unclear .
Because most media attention has shifted to Lebanon , the Israelis have had a free hand to continue pressing the Palestinians without international protest .
Palestinians continue to be killed on a daily basis not only in Gaza but also in Nablus , in the West Bank .
The fight is on between the two French titans — Trichet and Sarkozy — with the fate of Europe 's central bank hanging in the balance .
Melvyn Krauss is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution , Stanford University .
The appropriate level of the euro for the Germans is too high for the French and Italians .
The right interest rate for the French and Italians is too low for the Germans .
For reform laggards like France , Italy , and Portugal , currency union with an increasingly competitive Germany is forcing an unwelcome choice between revving up their own reforms and permanent stagnation .
This was followed by a shareholders meeting of the RAO UES , Russia 's electricity giant , now headed by the reformer turned oligarch , Anatoly Chubais .
The meeting was meant as a sign of Russia 's new business friendly climate , but the banner hanging over the hall - " Long Live the 80th Anniversary of Vladimir Lenin 's GOELRO Plan " - mocked that intent .
GOELRO 's ( State Organization for the Reconstruction and Development of the Soviet People 's Economy ) slogan was " Socialism means Soviet rule plus electrification of the country . "
Should Poland , Hungary and the Czech Republic be allowed in ?
Perhaps - but Serbia , Romania , Bulgaria are dubious ; even more so the idea of Russia as part of this new Europe .
Turkey is , of course , highly problematic .
BERLIN : I learned that the Berlin Wall was falling during an official visit to Poland ten years ago .
On the evening of November 9th , Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki invited my delegation to a banquet in the former palace of Prince Radziwill .
Before arriving at dinner , the Secretary of the Chancellery , Rudolf Seiters , called from Bonn .
The combative pacifist Gregory Yavlinsky of Yabloko and Sergei Stepashin , the former prime minister and architect of the Chechen War , now stand uneasily atop a joint party list for the December Duma elections .
Viktor Chernomyrdin says one day that he is willing to cooperate with his successor as prime minister , the free marketeer Sergei Kirienko , but huffs the next about dealing with his reform - minded predecessor , Yegor Gaidar .
Two days after that , he blubbers that he is thinking of throwing in his lot with Primakov and Luzhkov .
Licence to Rape has attracted wide attention in Southeast Asia .
Kraisak Choonhavan , Chairman of the Thai Senate 's Foreign Relations Committee and Vice Chairperson of the ASEAN Inter - Parliamentary Myanmar Caucus ( AIPMC ) , called for an investigation by the United Nations .
So did the UN General Assembly and the UN Human Rights Commission .
One Bush has practically succeeded another as America 's president , and the son of Singapore 's founder , Lee Kwan Hew , is to become the country 's premier .
Indeed , democratic leaders with dynastic dreams have bedeviled India , the Philippines , Indonesia , Sri Lanka , Haiti , and many other countries .
Until the Aliyev 's came along , only North Korea 's utterly loony Kim Il Sung managed to anoint his son atop a red throne .
The Al Jazeera Revolution Turns Ten
Although no one has yet caught up to Al Jazeera 's news and current affairs popularity , the Saudi - owned Middle East Broadcasting Center has introduced a successful 24 - hour station , Al Arrabiyeh , which is challenging Al Jazeera 's lead .
The Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation and Egypt 's Dream have also won large segments of the general Arab public with entertainment programs .
Al Jazeera has made Qatar famous and the Arab world better informed .
So other pressure will need to be applied , primarily by the European Union and the United States .
In 2004 , both the EU and US were tardy in speaking in defense of Ukraine 's democrats .
Only when the courage of millions of ordinary Ukrainians gathered in central Kyiv galvanized world opinion did the US and EU marshal the courage to stand up for an honest election result .
Perhaps its governing responsibilities will push Hamas toward ongoing discussions with the United States and the international community .
In any case , despite the election results , and even without Fatah in government , Abbas remains in charge of negotiations with Israel .
He has quickly called for a revival of peace talks , although Israel , like the US , has refused to deal with Hamas .
Russian President Vladimir Putin is poised to visit Pyongyang in July in search of support for his objections to America 's proposed anti - missile shield .
And just as these two Asian land powers cultivate Kim Jong Il , Washington is seeking talks over missiles with Pyongyang and Tokyo is eager to reestablish diplomatic relations with the North .
America and Japan helped push North Korea to talk with South Korea .
The government of Romano Prodi , having managed against all the odds to get Italy into Europe 's monetary union , fell three months later .
The Czech Republic , Poland , and Hungary have each endured a government crisis since EU accession .
Throughout Central and Eastern Europe , the EU is not as popular as it used to be .
The sometimes - brutal Israeli responses to such terrorism further embittered the Palestinians against Israel .
True , the sidelining of Arafat and the appointment of Abu Mazen as the Palestinian Prime Minister is an important step in the right direction .
But Abu Mazen 's real power has yet to be tested .
UN forces in Rwanda in 1994 were Annan 's responsibility before and during the crisis .
Annan was alerted four months before Hutu activists began their mass killings by a fax message from Romeo Dallaire , the Canadian general commanding UN forces in Rwanda .
Dallaire described in detail how the Hutus were planning " anti - Tutsi extermination . "
In February , President Bush declared the North a member of the " axis of evil " and in March the Pentagon singled North Korea as a possible target for a preemptive nuclear strike should it invade South Korea .
In April the Bush administration refused to certify that North Korea is abiding by the 1994 agreement to freeze its nuclear weapons program .
Now America is asking that North Korea accept International Atomic Energy Agency inspection on its nuclear sites .
One is a group of FSB ( the successor agency to the KGB ) men from St . Petersburg , headed by Security Council Secretary Sergei Ivanov .
The second consists of liberal economists and lawyers from Putin 's home town of St . Petersburg , with Minister of Finance Alexei Kudrin and Minister of Economy German Gref the leading lights .
The third faction is an " oligarchic " business - oriented group led by Putin 's chief of staff Alexander Voloshin , Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov and the secretive oil and aluminum tycoon Roman Abramovich , perhaps Russia 's richest man at age 33 .
Near Tel Aviv , in adjoining Jaffa , a competing militia under Hassan Salameh , took control .
In the north of the country , a Syrian - based militia , under Fawzi al - Kaukji , attacked Jewish villages .
The more moderate Haifa Arabs tried , not very successfully , to stay out of the fray .
Construction of the separation wall on the West Bank has made it almost impossible for Hamas fighters to reach Israel proper .
In addition , after the reoccupation of the West Bank 's cities in April 2002 , Israel arrested about 7000 Palestinians who are allegedly associated with Hamas , Fatah , and other Palestinian groups .
Continued armed struggle by Hamas will not be easy .
Although regional in scope and with a colorful international board of advisors , the Tharwa Project ( Tharwa means wealth in Arabic ) is based in Damascus and will be run from there .
The launch of the Tharwa Project one month ago inadvertently coincided with Kurdish riots that rocked northern Syria .
This , together with the prominence of the advisory board ( which includes well - known Egyptian sociologist Saad Eddin Ibrahim , French expert on political Islam Gilles Kepel , and Flynt Leverett , a Brookings Institution Fellow ) and the sensitivity of minority rights in general , combined to give the Project national , regional , and international notice .
What British imperial planners did was to stitch together three disparate provinces of the old Ottoman Empire and put at their head a prince from Hedjaz ( now a part of Saudi Arabia ) .
The three provinces - - Mosul , Baghdad , and Basra - - each had very distinct characters and very different population structures .
Mosul had a Kurdish majority , with significant Assyrian - Christian and Turkoman minorities ; Baghdad was mainly Sunni ; and Basra was predominantly Shi ' ite .
Previously , Egypt had ruled in Gaza , while Jordan annexed the West Bank .
The Hamas takeover in Gaza has – at least for now – ended that political unification .
Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has now set his conditions for dialogue .
Moreover , Egypt , Jordan , and Saudi Arabia – the three main Sunni Muslim regimes – are concerned that Gaza could provide a base for their regional non - Arab foe , Shiite Iran .
Their fear is based on Iranian support for Islamist groups – Sunni and Shiite – in Iraq , Lebanon , and Palestine , as well as its ongoing relationship with Syria .
If the Hamas - Fatah split brings about another territorial partition , Palestinians ' national aspirations will suffer their gravest setback in the last half - century .
Together with the US , the EU collectively has rallied around the Ahtisaari proposal .
But individually , a number of European countries – Spain , Greece , Italy , Cyprus , Romania , Slovakia , and Austria – are skeptical or negative toward Kosovo independence , which raises profound questions about the EU 's resolve .
Meanwhile , Serbian Prime Minister Vojislav Kostunica is waging a tireless and remarkably effective diplomatic campaign denouncing both Ahtisaari and his proposal .
The EU 's handling of relations with Serbia in the past only encouraged intransigence .
Instead of repeatedly making clear that Kosovo independence is an indispensable requirement for EU membership – so important to Serbia 's modernization and Balkan stability – EU leaders like Javier Solana laud Kostunica as a great democratic leader .
They relentlessly but unsuccessfully pressured Montenegro 's leaders to remain in a dysfunctional union with Serbia , condoned Kostunica 's dubious 2006 referendum on a new constitution enshrining Kosovo as a part of Serbia , and weakened demands for Serbia 's cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal in The Hague .
They want to prepare Abbas 's forces in Gaza for a confrontation with Hamas , which they believe is inevitable .
Israel is considering Abbas 's request to transfer arms and ammunitions from Egypt and Jordan in hopes of bolstering his loyalist forces .
There is also an American proposal to allow the Badr Brigade – a wing of the Palestine Liberation Army that is currently stationed in Jordan – to relocate to the Palestinian territories as Abbas 's rapid reaction force in Gaza in anticipation of a feared civil war .
The Badr Brigade is composed of several thousand Palestinians , mostly long - time PLO activists .
As the maneuvering continues , Israel and Egypt find themselves working together to bolster Abbas and Fatah .
With the Gaza Strip in its backyard , Egypt has already mediated several times between Hamas and Fatah , and has been trying , so far unsuccessfully , to arrange a swap of prisoners with Israel following Hamas 's abduction of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit .

Russia sent an impressive delegation to the World Economic Forum at Davos this year .
After strong representation under Boris Yeltsin , the level of Russia 's participants had slipped since Vladimir Putin became president .
This year , however , the Russians sent their " A " team , and a well - attended session focused on " Russia 's More Muscular Foreign Policy . "
Charles Taylor was President of Liberia when the Tribunal for Sierra Leone indicted him .
He had to flee his country , paving the way for the democratic transition that resulted in the recent election of Ellen Johnson Sirleaf .
Taylor still faces the prospect of trial and , another former dictator , Saddam Hussein , is now on trial before a national court in Iraq .
Diplomacy remained stalled until North Korea launched a series of missiles into the Sea of Japan in July .
Japan called for UN Security Council sanctions , and after ten days of wrangling , all five permanent members agreed on a resolution condemning North Korea 's actions .
Why did North Korea risk taking actions that defied China , its main benefactor , and brought about the UN resolution ?
But by far the biggest problem that NATO faces today is Afghanistan .
Hamid Karzai 's government remains weak , and the economy continues to be heavily dependent upon opium production .
The Taliban and Al Qaeda networks are re - emerging as political and military threats .
When Human Rights Watch declared last January that the Iraq War did not qualify as a humanitarian intervention , the international media took notice .
According to the Internet database Factiva , 43 news articles mentioned the report , in publications ranging from the Kansas City Star to the Beirut Daily Star .
Similarly , after the abuses of Iraqi detainees at the Abu Ghraib prison were disclosed , the views of Amnesty International and the International Committee of the Red Cross put pressure on the Bush administration both at home and abroad .
Mr . Taylor and Mr . Mugabe both blame the West for their countries ' woes .
President Mbeki was one of the three heads of state present at the handover ceremony from Taylor to Blah in Monrovia , Liberia 's capital .
Mbeki 's own brother , Moeletsi Mbeki , who heads the South Africa Institute for International Affairs , has a more forthright view of the political mayhem in Zimbabwe and the tardy pace of efforts to arrest the situation .
Yet Zimbabwe 's neighbors , particularly those in Southern Africa , have defended President Mugabe .
In late August , the heads of state of thirteen members of the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) , including Mugabe and President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa , the leading regional power , met in Dar es Salaam , Tanzania , to consider the challenges before them .
Among the 54 paragraphs of the Summit Final Communiqué , two dealt with Zimbabwe .
Yet the closing of The Daily News seems to have prompted the first signs that things may be changing .
Nigeria 's President Olusegun Obasanjo responded to the paper 's closure by announcing that Mugabe would not be invited to the December meeting of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting scheduled to take place in his capital , Abuja .
President Mbeki reacted to Obsanjo 's announcement with what South Africa 's business weekly , The Financial Mail , described as " surprise and consternation . "
Not long before the visit of the Chinese premier , India hosted US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice .
Ever since President Bill Clinton 's visit to India , but especially under President George W . Bush , the US has moved from relative indifference to India to the development of a strong strategic relationship .
This new approach might have seemed threatened by Al Qaeda 's attacks on America , which led to a strengthening of US relations with Pakistan 's General Parvez Musharaff .

Watanabe , a professor at Sophia University , was a collaborator of Shintaro Ishihara , the nationalist politician who wrote The Japan That Can Say No and is now the governor of Tokyo .
In the course of a couple of encounters , I heard him explain in front of large public audiences how the people of Manchuria had tears in their eyes when the occupying Kwantung Army left China , so grateful were they to Japan .
According to Watanabe , the Pacific War boiled down to race , as the US was determined to keep a non - white people down .
Indeed , a strong and united Europe will also make an important contribution to Russia 's sustainable modernization .
A weak and divided Europe will tempt Russia to pursue dangerous paths into the future .
Joschka Fischer , a leader in the Green Party for nearly 20 years , was Germany 's Foreign Minister and Vice Chancellor from 1998 to 2005 .
One example is the Media / Most group which , for reasons unknown , was financed by Gazprom to the tune of more than half a billion dollars !
It is even said in Moscow that a reason behind the recent arrest of Media / Most 's owner , Vladimir Gusinsky , in Spain on an Interpol warrant is the desire by Moscow prosecutors to discover everything Gusinsky knows about Gazprom 's inner workings .
But secret deals with Media / Most are but the tip of the iceberg .

In the cold light of day , the US government 's agreement to negotiate a successor treaty to the Kyoto Protocol within a UN framework is not a sign of real progress either .
This is so because members of both parties in the US Congress still repeat the mantra : Nothing without China !
Next week , President Bush , President Chirac , and Chancellor Schroeder will meet on the cliffs of Normandy to mark the 60th anniversary of the D - Day invasions that led to the liberation of Europe .
They should also seize the moment to liberate themselves from the bitterness that has divided the Atlantic Alliance over the Iraq War , argue Pierre Lellouche and Christoph Bertram .
When the United States launched the war against Saddam Hussein 's Iraq , France and Germany rightly warned that the invasion could well end up worsening instability in the Middle East and increase the threat of radical Islamic terror .

But Estonians , Latvians , and Lithuanians are not the only Europeans who should feel this way .
When Stalin offered Hitler his friendship in the spring of 1939 – formally concluded that summer in the Molotov - Ribbentrop Pact – Nazi aggression was assured of not being knifed in the back from the East and so was left with free hands to do as Hitler pleased in the West .
The Pact came after the pogroms of " Kristallnacht " in Germany , so its Soviet initiators knew pretty well to what destiny they were consigning the Jews of Poland and Lithuania , which , in accord with the first secret Protocol signed by Ribbentrop and Molotov on August 23 , 1939 , were to go to Hitler .
Still , skeptics say that NATO membership is unnecessary , that future membership in the EU should suffice .

Indeed , Serbia 's last presidential election became something of a referendum on Milosevic – and hence on Serbia 's relations with the West and the wider world .
The pro - Milosevic candidate , Tomislav Nikolic , lost , but he received 46 % of the vote .
Despite his campaign promises , Serbia 's President Boris Tadic has so far failed to cooperate with the ICTY by assisting in turning over Mladic ( Karadzic is probably not in Serbia ) , who would surely testify against Milosevic .

If the EU is to talk about membership with Turkey , there is no legitimate reason for keeping out my country , Ukraine ?
Current EU thinking , however , holds that Ukraine should be placed in the same framework as countries in North Africa and the Middle East .
The EU 's " Wider Europe " strategy does call for closer ties to Ukraine , and for allowing us increased access to the EU 's " single market . "
But membership in the EU does not mean estrangement from Russia .
Besides , excluding Ukraine from eventual EU membership will encourage Russia 's imperial ambitions .
Putin is shooting back , accusing the West of trying to weaken and dismember Russia .
As politicians in the West compare him to Mugabe or Mussolini , Putin 's Kremlin aides invoke the Munich appeasers who tried to push Hitler eastward .
Putin himself once blamed the West for trying to channel Muslim radicalism toward Russia .
In terms of raw power , Russia is clearly inferior to the former Soviet Union .
This Russia is neither capable , nor desirous of , full integration with the West .
But weakened , as it no doubt is , Putin 's Russia still regards itself as a great power .
All CIS countries - with the possible exception of Belarus - will retain their sovereignty .
When President Alexander Lukashenko departs , Belarus may fold into Russia as East Germany was absorbed by West Germany in the early 1990 's .
Russia 's transformation into an economic magnet for the CIS will be the major force of renewed Russian strategic influence .
We 're about to see if advertising works .
Hard on the heels of Friday 's 190-point stock-market plunge and the uncertainty that 's followed , a few big brokerage firms are rolling out new ads trumpeting a familiar message : Keep on investing , the market 's just fine .
Their mission is to keep clients from fleeing the market , as individual investors did in droves after the crash in October .
Just days after the 1987 crash , major brokerage firms rushed out ads to calm investors .
This time around , they 're moving even faster .
PaineWebber Inc . filmed a new television commercial at 4 p . m . EDT yesterday and had it on the air by last night .
Fidelity Investments placed new ads in newspapers yesterday , and wrote another new ad appearing today .
Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc . by yesterday afternoon had already written new TV ads .
It considered running them during tomorrow night 's World Series broadcast but decided not to when the market recovered yesterday .
Other brokerage firms , including Merrill Lynch & Co . , were plotting out potential new ad strategies .
The brokerage firms learned a lesson the last time around , when frightened investors flooded the phone lines and fled the market in a panic .
This time , the firms were ready .
Fidelity , for example , prepared ads several months ago in case of a market plunge .
When the market went into its free fall Friday afternoon , the investment firm ordered full pages in the Monday editions of half a dozen newspapers .
The ads touted Fidelity 's automated 800-number beneath the huge headline , `` Fidelity Is Ready For Your Call . ''
A Fidelity spokesman says the 800-line , which already was operating but which many clients did n't know about , received about double the usual volume of calls over the weekend .
`` A lot of investor confidence comes from the fact that they can speak to us , '' he says .
`` To maintain that dialogue is absolutely crucial .
It would have been too late to think about on Friday .
We had to think about it ahead of time . ''
Today 's Fidelity ad goes a step further , encouraging investors to stay in the market or even to plunge in with Fidelity .
Underneath the headline `` Diversification , '' it counsels , `` Based on the events of the past week , all investors need to know their portfolios are balanced to help protect them against the market 's volatility . ''
It goes on to plug a few diversified Fidelity funds by name .
PaineWebber also was able to gear up quickly thanks to the 1987 crash .
In the aftermath of the 1987 debacle , the brokerage firm began taping commercials in-house , ultimately getting its timing down fast enough to tape a commercial after the market closed and rush it on the air that night .
It also negotiated an arrangement with Cable News Network under which CNN would agree to air its last-minute creations .
The new PaineWebber commercial , created with ad agency Saatchi & Saatchi Co . , features Mary Farrell , one of the firm 's most visible investment strategists , sounding particularly bullish .
Taped just as the market closed yesterday , it offers Ms . Farrell advising , `` We view the market here as going through a relatively normal cycle ...
We continue to feel that the stock market is still the place to be for long-term appreciation . ''
The spot was scheduled to appear three times on CNN last night .
PaineWebber considered an even harder sell , recommending specific stocks .
Instead , it settled on just urging the clients who are its lifeline to keep that money in the market .
`` We 're saying the worst thing that anyone can do is to see the market go down and dump everything , which just drives the prices down further , '' says John Lampe , PaineWebber 's director of advertising .
`` If you owned it and liked it Friday , the true value has n't changed . ''
He adds , `` This is n't 1987 revisited . ''
With the market fluctuating and then closing up more than 88 points yesterday , investment firms had to constantly revise their approach .
At Shearson Lehman , executives created potential new commercials Friday night and throughout the weekend , then had to regroup yesterday afternoon .
The plan had been to make one of Shearson 's easy-to-film , black-and-white `` Where We Stand '' commercials , which have been running occasionally in response to news events since 1985 .
The ad would have run during the World Series tomorrow , replacing the debut commercial of Shearson 's new ad campaign , `` Leadership by Example '' .
But in a meeting after the market closed yesterday , Shearson executives decided not to go ahead with the stock-market ad .
`` We do n't think at this point anything needs to be said .
The market seems to be straightening out ; we 're taking a wait-and-see attitude , '' says Cathleen B . Stewart , executive vice president of marketing .
In any case , the brokerage firms are clearly moving faster to create new ads than they did in the fall of 1987 .
But it remains to be seen whether their ads will be any more effective .
In 1987 , despite a barrage of ads from most of the major investment firms , individuals ran from the market en masse .
Now the firms must try their hardest to prove that advertising can work this time around .
Ad Notes ...
ARNOLD ADVERTISING :
Edward Eskandarian , former chairman of Della Femina , McNamee WCRS/Boston , reached an agreement in principle to acquire a majority stake in Arnold Advertising , a small Boston shop .
Terms were n't disclosed .
Mr . Eskandarian , who resigned his Della Femina post in September , becomes chairman and chief executive of Arnold .
John Verret , the agency 's president and chief executive , will retain the title of president .
Separately , McDonald 's Corp . , Oak Brook , Ill . , named Arnold to handle its estimated $ 4 million cooperative ad account for the Hartford , Conn . , area .
That account had been handled by Della Femina , McNamee WCRS .
EDUCATION ADS :
A 142-page ad supplement to Business Week 's special `` Corporate Elite '' issue calls on business leaders to use their clout to help solve the nation 's education crisis .
The supplement , the largest ever for the magazine , includes ads from 52 corporate advertisers and kicks off a two-year Business Week initiative on education .
The magazine will distribute 10 % of the gross revenues from the supplement as grants to innovative teachers .
You know what the law of averages is , do n't you ?
It 's what 1 ) explains why we are like , well , ourselves rather than Bo Jackson ; 2 ) cautions that it 's possible to drown in a lake that averages two feet deep ; and 3 ) predicts that 10,000 monkeys placed before 10,000 pianos would produce 1,118 publishable rock 'n' roll tunes .
Baseball , that game of the long haul , is the quintessential sport of the mean , and the mean ol' law caught up with the San Francisco Giants in the World Series last weekend .
The team that dumped runs by the bushel on the Chicago Cubs in the National League playoffs was held to just one in two games by the home-team Oakland A 's , the gang that had been done unto similarly by the Los Angeles Dodgers and Orel Hershiser in last year 's tournament .
Morever , much of the damage was accomplished by A 's who had some catching up to do .
In game two , on a cool Sunday evening in this land of perpetual autumn , a lot of the catching up was done by the A 's catcher , Terry Steinbach .
He hit a 2 - 0 pitch from Rick Reuschel into the left-field stands in inning four to stretch his team 's lead from 2 - 1 to a decisive 5 - 1 , where it stayed .
So what if Steinbach had struck just seven home runs in 130 regular-season games , and batted in the seventh position of the A 's lineup .
`` If you get your pitch , and take a good swing , anything can happen , '' he later remarked .
On Saturday night , quite a few of the boys in green and gold salted away successes to salve the pain of past and , no doubt , future droughts .
Mark McGwire , the big , red-haired Oakland first baseman , had three hits in four at bats , two more than he 'd had in the five-game Dodger series in which he 'd gone 1-for-17 .
The A-men batting Nos . 6 through 9 , a.k.a . the `` bottom of the order , '' got seven of their team 's 11 hits and scored four of its runs in a 5 - 0 decision .
Right-hander Dave Stewart held the Giants to five hits to account for the zero on the other side of the Saturday ledger .
That he was the A 's winningest pitcher during its American League campaign with a 21 - 9 mark , plus two wins over Toronto in the playoffs , indicates he may have some evening up coming , but with the way his split-fingered fastball is behaving , that might not be this week .
The same goes for Mike Moore , another veteran who overcame early struggles to permit the Giants but a run and four hits in seven innings in Sunday 's contest .
`` Every guy they put out there had a better split-finger than the guy before , '' marveled Giant manager Roger Craig .
He 's an ex-hurler who 's one of the leading gurus of the fashionable delivery , which looks like a fastball until it dives beneath the lunging bat .
The upshot of the downshoot is that the A 's go into San Francisco 's Candlestick Park tonight up two games to none in the best-of-seven fest .
The stat to reckon with here says that about three of four clubs ( 29 of 39 ) that took 2 - 0 Series leads went on to win it all .
That 's not an average to soothe Giant rooters .
One might think that the home fans in this Series of the Subway Called BART ( that 's a better name for a public conveyance than `` Desire , '' do n't you think ? ) would have been ecstatic over the proceedings , but they observe them in relative calm .
Partisans of the two combatants sat side by side in the 49,000-plus seats of Oakland Coliseum , and while they cheered their favorites and booed the opposition , hostilities advanced no further , at least as far as I could see .
A few folks even showed up wearing caps bearing the colors and emblems of both teams .
`` I 'm for the Giants today , but only because they lost yesterday .
I love 'em both .
The only thing I 'm rooting for is for the Series to go seven games , '' said David Williams , a Sacramento septuagenarian , at the Coliseum before Sunday 's go .
The above represents a triumph of either apathy or civility .
I choose to believe it 's the latter , although it probably springs from the fact that just about everyone out here , including the A 's and Giants , is originally from somewhere else .
Suffice it to say that if this were a New York Yankees-Mets series , or one between the Chicago Cubs and White Sox ( hey , it 's possible ) , you 'd need uniformed police in every other seat to separate opposing fans , and only the suicidal would bifurcate their bonnets .
Anyway , the A 's gave you a lot of heroes to root for .
In the opening game , besides Steinbach and Stewart , there was Walt Weiss , a twiggy-looking , second-year shortstop who had lost a couple months of the season to knee surgery .
He was flawless afield ( ditto in game two ) , moved a runner along in the A 's three-run second inning , and homered for his team 's final tally .
Such is his reputation among the East Bay Bashers that when he hit his first career home run last season , the fan who caught it agreed to turn the ball over to him in return for an autograph .
Not his autograph ; power-hitter McGwire 's .
An A 's co-hero of the second game was Rickey Henderson , who exemplifies the hot side of the hot - cold equation .
He smoked Toronto in the playoffs with six hits , seven walks and eight stolen bases in 22 at bats , and continued that by going 3-for-3 at the plate Sunday , along with walking , stealing a base and scoring a run .
`` When you 're in the groove , you see every ball tremendously , '' he lectured .
The cold guys in the set were Will Clark , Kevin Mitchell and Matt Williams , the Giants ' 3-4-5 hitters .
They combined for 25 hits , six home runs and 24 runs batted in in the five games against the Cubs .
They went a collective 5-for-24 here , with zero homers and ribbies .
It 's that last set of numbers , as much as anything else , that gives the Giants hope in the Series games to come .
`` I believe in the law of averages , '' declared San Francisco batting coach Dusty Baker after game two .
`` I 'd rather see a so-so hitter who 's hot come up for the other side than a good hitter who 's cold . ''
But the old Dodger slugger wisely offered no prediction about when good times would return to his side .
`` When it goes , you never know when you 'll get it back , '' he said .
`` That 's baseball . "
NCR Corp . reported a 10 % drop in third-quarter net income , citing intense competition that caused its gross profit margins to dip .
Net income for the quarter fell to $ 93.1 million from $ 103.1 million , roughly what analysts had expected .
But per-share profit dropped only 2 % to $ 1.23 a share from $ 1.26 a share , as the company continued its stock buy-back plan .
Average shares outstanding dropped to 75.8 million from 82.1 million .
Revenue fell 1 % to $ 1.39 billion from $ 1.41 billion .
The computer maker , which sells more than half its goods outside the U . S . , also said the negative effect of a stronger U . S . dollar will `` adversely affect '' its fourth-quarter performance and `` make it difficult '' to better 1988 results .
NCR said revenue declined both in the U . S . and overseas , reflecting a world-wide softening of the computer markets .
The company , however , said orders in the U . S . showed `` good gains '' during the latest quarter .
Analysts estimate those gains at 12 % to 13 % , a good part of it coming from large orders placed by a few of NCR 's major customers .
In addition to a general slowing of the computer industry , NCR , which sells automated teller machines and computerized cash registers , is also affected by the retail and financial sectors , `` areas of the economy that have generally not been robust , '' notes Sanjiv G . Hingorani , an analyst for Salomon Brothers Inc .
These factors , combined with a strong dollar , should negatively affect the current quarter 's results , NCR said .
In the year-earlier fourth quarter , NCR had profit of $ 149.6 million , or $ 1.85 a share , on revenue of $ 1.8 billion .
Mr . Hingorani said he lowered his full-year estimates for 1989 to $ 5.35 a share from $ 5.50 a share .
Revenue projections were slashed to $ 6.03 billion from $ 6.20 billion .
Last year , NCR had net income of $ 439.3 million , or $ 5.33 a share , on $ 5.99 billion in revenue .
For the nine months , the company 's earnings fell 9 % to $ 264.6 million , or $ 3.40 a share , from $ 289.7 million , or $ 3.49 a share .
Revenues declined 1 % to $ 4.17 billion from $ 4.19 billion .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , NCR shares fell 75 cents to close at $ 57 .
J . P . Morgan & Co . swung to a loss in the third quarter , while NCNB Corp . reported net income more than doubled , and Security Pacific Corp . net rose 10 % .
J . P . Morgan & Co .
J . P . Morgan , as expected , posted a $ 1.82 billion net loss for the quarter , reflecting the New York bank 's decision last month to add $ 2 billion to reserves for losses on loans to less-developed countries .
The reserve addition placed the parent of Morgan Guaranty Trust Co . among a few major U . S . banks that have covered nearly all their medium and long-term portfolios to less-developed countries with reserves .
The latest quarter 's loss equals $ 9.92 a share .
In the year-earlier quarter , Morgan earned $ 233.6 million , or $ 1.25 a share .
George M . Salem , analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc . , called the results `` mildly disappointing . ''
Excluding the $ 2 billion provision and allowing for the taxes Morgan paid , earnings were about 65 cents a share , Mr . Salem said .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , Morgan climbed $ 1.50 a share to $ 44.125 .
Net interest income sank 27 % in the quarter to $ 254 million from $ 347 million .
The interest rate on short-term funds , which banks borrow to finance longer-term loans to customers , was `` sharply higher , '' Morgan said .
Morgan received $ 2 million of interest payments on its medium and long-term Brazilian loans ; had they been accruing interest , net interest income would have been $ 35 million higher in the quarter , Morgan said .
Such loans to Argentina also remain classified as non-accruing , costing the bank $ 10 million of interest income in the third period .
Income from sources other than interest climbed 12 % to $ 414 million , reflecting higher corporate-finance and other fees and gains on sales of investment securities .
`` These increases were partly offset by lower trading-related '' income , the bank said .
Non-interest expenses grew 16 % to $ 496 million .
NCNB Corp .
NCNB Corp . 's net income more than doubled in the period , largely because of continued strong performance by the bank 's Texas operations .
The Charlotte , N . C . , company said earnings rose to $ 143.6 million , or $ 1.45 a share , from $ 58.9 million , or 69 cents a share , a year earlier .
The latest quarter included a gain of $ 56.1 million , or 59 cents a share , related to the purchase of the remaining 51 % of NCNB Texas National Bank from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp .
The strong performance , however , contrasted with an unexpectedly large increase in the size of NCNB 's problem loans , particularly in the Southeast .
In the third quarter , nonperforming assets jumped to $ 474.1 million , or 1.43 % of net loans and leases , from $ 232.8 million , or 1.13 % in the second quarter .
Nonperformers totaled $ 230.8 million , or 1.27 % in the year-ago third quarter .
Included in the increase in the most recent quarter is a $ 33 million loan , which NCNB said it `` expects to be fully repaid , with no loss , early in the fourth quarter . ''
The deterioration in credit quality offset strong loan growth of 17 % in NCNB 's Southeast operations , as well as a 28 % growth in deposits resulting from an aggressive marketing campaign .
The higher rates paid on deposits also helped squeeze NCNB 's net interest margin in the Southeast to 3.38 % from 3.80 % a year earlier .
In Big Board composite trading yesterday , NCNB jumped $ 3.50 a share , to $ 51 .
Results were released after the market closed .
NCNB Texas National , formed from the remnants of of the failed First RepublicBank Corp . of Dallas , contributed $ 76.9 million to NCNB 's bottom line in the third quarter .
NCNB said its third-quarter results reflect 100 % of earnings of the Texas operation since Aug . 1 .
NCNB raised some $ 1.9 billion in new capital during the quarter to complete the NCNB Texas purchase , and to acquire several small failed thrifts to fill out its regional franchise .
Last week , the banking company said it purchased both Freedom Savings & Loan Association , Tampa , Fla . , and University Federal Savings Association of San Antonio , Texas , for $ 169.4 million .
In the first nine months , NCNB 's net income climbed 65 % to $ 310.9 million , or $ 3.30 a share , from $ 188.2 million , or $ 2.22 a share , a year earlier .
Security Pacific Corp .
Security Pacific 's earnings growth slowed in the third quarter , but the Los Angeles bank holding company was still able to post a 10 % increase in net income because of robust growth in residential real-estate and consumer loans .
Net rose to $ 185.1 million , or $ 1.55 a share , from $ 167.9 million , or $ 1.47 a share , a year earlier .
The company said the gain resulted mainly from a $ 54 million increase in net interest income , reflecting a 33 % increase in real estate loans -LRB- mainly residential -RRB- , and a 19 % rise in consumer loans .
These high-yielding loans in effect replaced some low-yielding assets such as inter-bank loans , which were allowed to decrease .
As a result , Security Pacific 's net interest margin fell only 13 basis points , a more mild decrease than some major banks outside California , which have been reporting more sluggish earnings .
Security Pacific shares closed at $ 44.625 , down 37.5 cents , in Big Board composite trading .
The earnings represent a 0.89 % return on assets for Security Pacific , and an 18.9 % return on equity .
The loan growth offset continuing real-estate loan losses in the depressed Arizona market .
Security Pacific reported a 33 % increase in net credit losses for the quarter , to $ 109 million from $ 81.9 million in the year-ago period .
Nonperforming loans grew slightly to $ 1.75 billion at Sept . 30 , from $ 1.7 billion a year ago .
Security Pacific 's loan-loss provision was down 22 % , or $ 30.4 million , because it added to its foreign-debt reserve the year before .
Non-interest income fell 6 % in the quarter , mainly because of an unusual gain a year earlier from the sale of Hong Kong banking operations .
Non-interest expense grew only 4 % in the period .
For the nine months , net rose 17 % to $ 548.9 million , or $ 4.67 a share , from $ 469.4 million , or $ 4.13 a share , a year earlier .
LIN Broadcasting Corp . said it wo n't take a position on a revised tender offer by McCaw Cellular Communications Inc . to buy LIN and has asked for clarification of the offer .
The new offer , which seeks 50.3 % of the cellular and broadcasting concern , is for $ 125 a share for 22 million LIN shares .
McCaw 's revised tender offer would require McCaw to begin an auction process in July 1994 that would buy out remaining holders at a per-share price roughly equivalent to what a third party might then have to pay for all of LIN .
LIN is asking McCaw to clarify its tender offer , which challenges an agreement between BellSouth Corp . and LIN to merge their cellular-telephone businesses .
BellSouth has notified LIN that it would `` shortly respond to the McCaw proposal in as full and effective a manner as is warranted . ''
The LIN board said holders may be misled by the provision in the McCaw proposal that `` guarantees '' private market value after five years for the remaining shares .
McCaw has `` no obligation to purchase and the definition of private market value is uncertain , '' the LIN board said .
The board added that McCaw would be able to control LIN 's operations and could , `` therefore , operate LIN in a manner which could diminish its private market value and attractiveness to a third-party purchaser in five years . ''
In national over-the-counter trading , LIN closed at $ 104.75 , down $ 2.75 .
U . S . Trade Representative Carla Hills said the first dispute-settlement panel set up under the U.S.-Canadian `` free trade '' agreement has ruled that Canada 's restrictions on exports of Pacific salmon and herring violate the accord .
Mrs . Hills said the U . S . and Canada have until Nov . 13 to resolve the dispute .
If a solution is n't reached by then , she said , the U . S . would have the right to suspend some trade concessions to Canada equivalent in value to the losses suffered by U.S . fish-processing companies in Alaska and the Pacific Northwest .
However , in Ottawa , Canadian Trade Minister John Crosbie said the dispute-settlement panel accepted the `` legitimacy of Canada 's position on the use of these landing requirements to conserve and manage these important fisheries . ''
Questioned about the seeming contradiction in the U . S . and Canadian government views of the panel 's report , an aide for Mrs . Hills said the panel had clearly ruled that the Canadian trade restrictions `` are illegal '' .
The U . S . trade representative declined to put a dollar estimate on the losses resulting from the Canadian export restrictions .
Canada initially had an export prohibition that was replaced by regulations requiring that such fish had to be brought ashore in British Columbia by commercial fishermen prior to export .
This action was defended by the Canadian government on conservation grounds .
Mrs . Hills said yesterday that the dispute-settlement panel rejected this Canadian government argument .
`` We fully expect that Canada will comply with the panel 's ruling '' that the `` landing requirement '' also must be ended , she said .
Earlier , an international panel set up under the rules of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in Geneva determined that the original Canadian fish-export restrictions violated GATT rules .
Mrs . Hills said the U . S . wo n't accept any delays after Nov . 13 because U . S . fish-processing firms enter into contracts in the fall to purchase the next season 's catch .
She said the Canadian restrictions must be removed before such contracts are concluded .
What happened Friday shows that financial markets are not yet sufficiently coordinated to handle another meltdown in prices .
No fiddling with systems and procedures will ever prevent markets from suffering a panic wave of selling .
But markets can operate with greater or lesser efficiency .
After the 1987 plunge , markets agreed that it would be wise to halt trading whenever panic conditions arose .
The New York Stock Exchange adopted two specific circuit breakers : If the Dow Jones index falls 250 points in a day , the exchange will halt trading for one hour ; if the decline hits 400 points , the exchange will close for an additional two hours .
The rationale is that an interruption of trading will allow investors to reconsider their strategies , calm sellers and lead buyers to enter the market at indicated new price levels .
It is impossible to know whether that theory is realistic .
A temporary cessation of trading may indeed discourage a selling panic from feeding on itself .
But there is also the possibility that shutting down markets will intensify fears and cause an even more abrupt slide in prices .
What happened Friday was the worst of all worlds .
The futures exchanges followed their own pre-set circuit breakers and shut down at about 3 p . m . for 30 minutes , after the Standard & Poor 's 500 stock index had fallen 12 points , or about 100 points on the Dow Jones index .
Options markets stopped trading in many securities .
The New York Stock Exchange , under its own rules , remained open .
With nowhere else to go , sellers , and particularly program traders , focused all their selling on the New York Stock Exchange .
As liquidity on that market weakened , prices fell sharply .
Had the futures and options markets been open , additional liquidity would have been provided and the decline , most probably , would have been less intense .
At 3 : 30 , after intense telephone negotiations between the trading markets and Washington , the futures exchanges reopened .
Futures trading , however , was halted altogether at 3 : 45 , after the futures markets had dropped an additional 30 points , which is the daily limit for price declines .
At this point , the options markets also shut down and once more left all sales to be handled by the New York Stock Exchange .
It is time to recognize that the New York Stock Exchange , the futures markets and the options markets , though physically separate , have actually become so closely intertwined as to constitute one market effectively .
Traders can vary their strategies and execute their orders in any one of them .
It therefore makes no sense for each market to adopt different circuit breakers .
To achieve maximum liquidity and minimize price volatility , either all markets should be open to trading or none .
Synchronized circuit breakers would not have halted the slide in prices on Friday , but they probably would have made for smoother , less volatile executions .
It 's time for the exchanges and the Securities and Exchange Commission to agree on joint conditions for halting trading or staying open .
Let 's not have one market shut down for 30 minutes when the Dow declines 100 points and another shut down for an hour after a 250-point decline .
The need for hurried last-minute telephone negotiations among market officials will disappear once rules are in place that synchronize circuit breakers in all markets .
The new circuit breakers , if they are to be applied at all , will require that futures and options trading continue as long as the New York Stock Exchange remains open .
The rules should be established by agreement of the officials of all affected exchanges acting under the oversight and with the approval of the government regulatory agencies .
Should the SEC and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission ( which , with the SEC , regulates the Chicago stock-index markets ) be unable to agree , the issue may have to be resolved by decision of the Treasury secretary .
In many ways , our financial markets are better prepared today to handle a decline than they were two years ago .
The New York Stock Exchange now has the capacity to handle a volume of nearly a billion shares a day .
Telephone service has been improved for customers trying to reach their brokers , and specialists -- who I believe should stay , despite the urgings of some post-crash critics -- have larger capital positions .
( Of course , specialists ' actions alone can never prevent a major crack in stock prices .
Witness the fact that trading in some stocks closed early Friday and opened late Monday because of an excess of sell orders . )
But the task of improving market performance remains unfinished .
Mr . Freund , former chief economist of the New York Stock Exchange , is a professor of economics at Pace University 's business school in New York .
U . S . Banknote Co . said it again extended the expiration date of its $ 7-a-share tender offer for International Banknote Co . to Nov . 15 .
U . S . Banknote said it is in negotiations to sell `` certain facilities , '' which it did n't name , to a third party , and it needs the extension to try to reach a definitive agreement on the sale .
U . S . Banknote said it believes the sale , if completed , apparently would satisfy antitrust issues raised by the U . S . Justice Department about U . S . Banknote 's offer to buy International Banknote .
Both of the New York-based companies print stock certificates and currency .
U . S . Banknote said `` there can be no assurance '' a sale agreement would be concluded .
It also said the tender offer would probably have to be extended further to complete financing arrangements .
U . S . Banknote said Citibank extended the expiration date of its commitment for senior secured financing to Nov . 15 .
The offer , made June 1 , has been extended several times .
Closely held U . S . Banknote offered the $ 7 a share , or $ 126 million , for as many as 14.9 million shares , or 78.6 % , of International Banknote 's shares outstanding .
U . S . Banknote said that as of Oct . 13 , 16.1 million shares , or about 84.3 % of the fully diluted shares outstanding , had been tendered .
Enron Corp . , Houston , said the sale of preference units of its newly formed Enron NGL Partners L . P . master limited partnership subsidiary will result in an undetermined gain in the fourth quarter .
In the year-ago quarter , the natural gas concern had net income of $ 25.2 million , or 34 cents a share , on revenue of about $ 1.46 billion .
Those results included a $ 2.7 million charge related to the retirement of debt .
In a related move , Enron said it increased the number of the partnership 's units it will offer to 6,930,000 from 5,500,000 .
The old and revised numbers both include over-allotment provisions .
Enron said each unit will be priced in the $ 19-to-$21 range and will represent about 80 % of the partnership equity .
Net proceeds from the offering are expected to be close to $ 200 million .
Goldman , Sachs & Co . , and Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc . are lead underwriters .
Arthur M . Goldberg said he extended his unsolicited tender offer of $ 32 a share tender offer , or $ 154.3 million , for Di Giorgio Corp . to Nov . 1 .
DIG Acquisition Corp . , the New Jersey investor 's acquisition vehicle , said that as of the close of business yesterday , 560,839 shares had been tendered .
Including the stake DIG already held , DIG holds a total of about 25 % of Di Giorgio 's shares on a fully diluted basis .
The offer , which also includes common and preferred stock purchase rights , was to expire last night at midnight .
The new expiration date is the date on which DIG 's financing commitments , which total about $ 240 million , are to expire .
DIG is a unit of DIG Holding Corp . , a unit of Rose Partners L . P .
Mr . Goldberg is the sole general partner in Rose Partners .
In August , Di Giorgio , a San Francisco food products and building materials marketing and distribution company , rejected Mr . Goldberg 's offer as inadequate .
In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday , Di Giorgio closed at $ 31.50 a share , down $ 1.75 .
A consortium of private investors operating as LJH Funding Co . said it has made a $ 409 million cash bid for most of L . J . Hooker Corp . 's real-estate and shopping-center holdings .
The $ 409 million bid includes the assumption of an estimated $ 300 million in secured liabilities on those properties , according to those making the bid .
The group is led by Jay Shidler , chief executive officer of Shidler Investment Corp . in Honolulu , and A . Boyd Simpson , chief executive of the Atlanta-based Simpson Organization Inc .
Mr . Shidler 's company specializes in commercial real-estate investment and claims to have $ 1 billion in assets ; Mr . Simpson is a developer and a former senior executive of L . J . Hooker .
`` The assets are good , but they require more money and management '' than can be provided in L . J . Hooker 's current situation , said Mr . Simpson in an interview . ``
Hooker 's philosophy was to build and sell .
We want to build and hold .
L . J . Hooker , based in Atlanta , is operating with protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the U . S . Bankruptcy Code .
Its parent company , Hooker Corp . of Sydney , Australia , is currently being managed by a court-appointed provisional liquidator .
Sanford Sigoloff , chief executive of L . J . Hooker , said yesterday in a statement that he has not yet seen the bid but that he would review it and bring it to the attention of the creditors committee .
The $ 409 million bid is estimated by Mr . Simpson as representing 75 % of the value of all Hooker real-estate holdings in the U . S . .
Not included in the bid are Bonwit Teller or B . Altman & Co . , L . J . Hooker 's department-store chains .
The offer covers the massive 1.8 million-square-foot Forest Fair Mall in Cincinnati , the 800,000 square-foot Richland Fashion Mall in Columbia , S . C . , and the 700,000 square-foot Thornton Town Center mall in Thornton , Colo .
The Thornton mall opened Sept . 19 with a Bigg 's hypermarket as its anchor ; the Columbia mall is expected to open Nov . 15 .
Other Hooker properties included are a 20-story office tower in midtown Atlanta , expected to be completed next February ; vacant land sites in Florida and Ohio ; L . J . Hooker International , the commercial real-estate brokerage company that once did business as Merrill Lynch Commercial Real Estate , plus other shopping centers .
The consortium was put together by Hoare Govett , the London-based investment banking company that is a subsidiary of Security Pacific Corp .
`` We do n't anticipate any problems in raising the funding for the bid , '' said Allan Campbell , the head of mergers and acquisitions at Hoare Govett , in an interview .
Hoare Govett is acting as the consortium 's investment bankers .
According to people familiar with the consortium , the bid was code-named Project Klute , a reference to the film `` Klute '' in which a prostitute played by actress Jane Fonda is saved from a psychotic businessman by a police officer named John Klute .
L . J . Hooker was a small home-building company based in Atlanta in 1979 when Mr . Simpson was hired to push it into commercial development .
The company grew modestly until 1986 , when a majority position in Hooker Corp . was acquired by Australian developer George Herscu , currently Hooker 's chairman .
Mr . Herscu proceeded to launch an ambitious , but ill-fated , $ 1 billion acquisition binge that included Bonwit Teller and B . Altman & Co . , as well as majority positions in Merksamer Jewelers , a Sacramento chain ; Sakowitz Inc . , the Houston-based retailer , and Parisian Inc . , the Southeast department-store chain .
Eventually Mr . Simpson and Mr . Herscu had a falling out over the direction of the company , and Mr . Simpson said he resigned in 1988 .
Since then , Hooker Corp . has sold its interest in the Parisian chain back to Parisian 's management and is currently attempting to sell the B . Altman & Co . chain .
In addition , Robert Sakowitz , chief executive of the Sakowitz chain , is seeking funds to buy out the Hooker interest in his company .
The Merksamer chain is currently being offered for sale by First Boston Corp .
Reached in Honolulu , Mr . Shidler said that he believes the various Hooker malls can become profitable with new management .
`` These are n't mature assets , but they have the potential to be so , '' said Mr . Shidler .
`` Managed properly , and with a long-term outlook , these can become investment-grade quality properties .
Ripples from the strike by 55,000 Machinists union members against Boeing Co . reached air carriers Friday as America West Airlines announced it will postpone its new service out of Houston because of delays in receiving aircraft from the Seattle jet maker .
Peter Otradovec , vice president for planning at the Phoenix , Ariz . , carrier , said in an interview that the work stoppage at Boeing , now entering its 13th day , `` has caused some turmoil in our scheduling '' and that more than 500 passengers who were booked to fly out of Houston on America West would now be put on other airlines .
Mr . Otradovec said Boeing told America West that the 757 it was supposed to get this Thursday would n't be delivered until Nov . 7 -- the day after the airline had been planning to initiate service at Houston with four daily flights , including three nonstops to Phoenix and one nonstop to Las Vegas .
Now , those routes are n't expected to begin until Jan .
Boeing is also supposed to send to America West another 757 twin-engine aircraft as well as a 737 by year 's end .
Those , too , are almost certain to arrive late .
At this point , no other America West flights -- including its new service at San Antonio , Texas ; Newark , N . J . ; and Palmdale , Calif . -- have been affected by the delays in Boeing deliveries .
Nevertheless , the company 's reaction underscores the domino effect that a huge manufacturer such as Boeing can have on other parts of the economy .
It also is sure to help the machinists put added pressure on the company .
`` I just do n't feel that the company can really stand or would want a prolonged walkout , '' Tom Baker , president of Machinists ' District 751 , said in an interview yesterday .
`` I do n't think their customers would like it very much . ''
America West , though , is a smaller airline and therefore more affected by the delayed delivery of a single plane than many of its competitors would be .
`` I figure that American and United probably have such a hard time counting all the planes in their fleets , they might not miss one at all , '' Mr . Otradovec said .
Indeed , a random check Friday did n't seem to indicate that the strike was having much of an effect on other airline operations .
Southwest Airlines has a Boeing 737 - 300 set for delivery at the end of this month and expects to have the plane on time .
`` It 's so close to completion , Boeing 's told us there wo n't be a problem , '' said a Southwest spokesman .
A spokesman for AMR Corp . said Boeing has assured American Airlines it will deliver a 757 on time later this month .
American is preparing to take delivery of another 757 in early December and 20 more next year and is n't anticipating any changes in that timetable .
In Seattle , a Boeing spokesman explained that the company has been in constant communication with all of its customers and that it was impossible to predict what further disruptions might be triggered by the strike .
Meanwhile , supervisors and non-striking employees have been trying to finish some 40 aircraft -- mostly 747 and 767 jumbo jets at the company 's Everett , Wash . , plant -- that were all but completed before the walkout .
As of Friday , four had been delivered and a fifth plane , a 747 - 400 , was supposed to be flown out over the weekend to Air China .
No date has yet been set to get back to the bargaining table .
`` We want to make sure they know what they want before they come back , '' said Doug Hammond , the federal mediator who has been in contact with both sides since the strike began .
The investment community , for one , has been anticipating a speedy resolution .
Though Boeing 's stock price was battered along with the rest of the market Friday , it actually has risen over the last two weeks on the strength of new orders .
`` The market has taken two views : that the labor situation will get settled in the short term and that things look very rosy for Boeing in the long term , '' said Howard Rubel , an analyst at Cyrus J . Lawrence Inc .
Boeing 's shares fell $ 4 Friday to close at $ 57.375 in composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange .
But Mr . Baker said he thinks the earliest a pact could be struck would be the end of this month , hinting that the company and union may resume negotiations as early as this week .
Still , he said , it 's possible that the strike could last considerably longer .
`` I would n't expect an immediate resolution to anything . ''
Last week , Boeing Chairman Frank Shrontz sent striking workers a letter , saying that `` to my knowledge , Boeing 's offer represents the best overall three-year contract of any major U . S . industrial firm in recent history . ''
But Mr . Baker called the letter -- and the company 's offer of a 10 % wage increase over the life of the pact , plus bonuses -- `` very weak '' .
He added that the company miscalculated the union 's resolve and the workers ' disgust with being forced to work many hours overtime .
In separate developments : -- Talks have broken off between Machinists representatives at Lockheed Corp . and the Calabasas , Calif . , aerospace company .
The union is continuing to work through its expired contract , however .
It had planned a strike vote for next Sunday , but that has been pushed back indefinitely .
-- United Auto Workers Local 1069 , which represents 3,000 workers at Boeing 's helicopter unit in Delaware County , Pa . , said it agreed to extend its contract on a day-by-day basis , with a 10-day notification to cancel , while it continues bargaining .
The accord expired yesterday .
-- And Boeing on Friday said it received an order from Martinair Holland for four model 767 - 300 wide-body jetliners valued at a total of about $ 326 million .
The planes , long range versions of the medium-haul twin-jet , will be delivered with Pratt & Whitney PW4060 engines .
Pratt & Whitney is a unit of United Technologies Inc .
Martinair Holland is based in Amsterdam .
A Boeing spokeswoman said a delivery date for the planes is still being worked out `` for a variety of reasons , but not because of the strike . ''

Atco Ltd . said its utilities arm is considering building new electric power plants , some valued at more than one billion Canadian dollars ( US$ 851 million ) , in Great Britain and elsewhere .
C . S . Richardson , Atco 's senior vice president , finance , said its 50.1%-owned Canadian Utilities Ltd . unit is reviewing cogeneration projects in eastern Canada , and conventional electric power generating plants elsewhere , including Britain , where the British government plans to allow limited competition in electrical generation from private-sector suppliers as part of its privatization program .
`` The projects are big .
They can be C$ 1 billion plus , '' Mr . Richardson said .
`` But we would n't go into them alone , '' and Canadian Utilities ' equity stake would be small , he said .
`` Ideally , we 'd like to be the operator -LSB- of the project -RSB- and a modest equity investor .
Our long suit is our proven ability to operate '' power plants , he said .
Mr . Richardson would n't offer specifics regarding Atco 's proposed British project , but he said it would compete for customers with two huge British power generating companies that would be formed under the country 's plan to privatize its massive water and electric utilities .
Britain 's government plans to raise about # 20 billion ( $ 31.05 billion ) from the sale of most of its giant water and electric utilities , beginning next month .
The planned electric utility sale , scheduled for next year , is alone expected to raise # 13 billion , making it the world 's largest public offering .
Under terms of the plan , independent generators would be able to compete for 15 % of customers until 1994 , and for another 10 % between 1994 and 1998 .
Canadian Utilities had 1988 revenue of C$ 1.16 billion , mainly from its natural gas and electric utility businesses in Alberta , where the company serves about 800,000 customers .
`` There seems to be a move around the world to deregulate the generation of electricity , '' Mr . Richardson said , and Canadian Utilities hopes to capitalize on it .
`` This is a real thrust on our utility side , '' he said , adding that Canadian Utilities is also mulling projects in underdeveloped countries , though he would be specific .
Canadian Utilities is n't alone in exploring power generation opportunities in Britain , in anticipation of the privatization program .
`` We 're certainly looking at some power generating projects in England , '' said Bruce Stram , vice president , corporate strategy and corporate planning , with Enron Corp . , Houston , a big natural gas producer and pipeline operator .
Mr . Stram said Enron is considering building gas-fired power plants in the U . K . capable of producing about 500 megawatts of power at a cost of about $ 300 million to $ 400 million .
Kaufman & Broad Home Corp . said it formed a $ 53.4 million limited partnership subsidiary to buy land in California suitable for residential development .
The partnership , Kaufman & Broad Land Development Venture Limited Partnership , is a 50 - 50 joint venture with a trust created by institutional clients of Heitman Advisory Corp . , a unit of Heitman Financial Corp . , a real estate advisory , management and development company with offices in Chicago and Beverly Hills , Calif .
Kaufman & Broad , a home building company , declined to identify the institutional investors .
The land to be purchased by the joint venture has n't yet received zoning and other approvals required for development , and part of Kaufman & Broad 's job will be to obtain such approvals .
The partnership runs the risk that it may not get the approvals for development , but in return , it can buy land at wholesale rather than retail prices , which can result in sizable savings , said Bruce Karatz , president and chief executive officer of Kaufman & Broad .
`` There are really very few companies that have adequate capital to buy properties in a raw state for cash .
Typically , developers option property , and then once they get the administrative approvals , they buy it , '' said Mr . Karatz , adding that he believes the joint venture is the first of its kind .
`` We usually operate in that conservative manner . ''
By setting up the joint venture , Kaufman & Broad can take the more aggressive approach of buying raw land , while avoiding the negative impacts to its own balance sheet , Mr . Karatz said .
The company is putting up only 10 % of the capital , although it is responsible for providing management , planning and processing services to the joint venture .
`` This is one of the best ways to assure a pipeline of land to fuel our growth at a minimum risk to our company , '' Mr . Karatz said .
RJR Nabisco Inc . is disbanding its division responsible for buying network advertising time , just a month after moving 11 of the group 's 14 employees to New York from Atlanta .
A spokesman for the New York-based food and tobacco giant , taken private earlier this year in a $ 25 billion leveraged buy-out by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co . , confirmed that it is shutting down the RJR Nabisco Broadcast unit , and dismissing its 14 employees , in a move to save money .
The spokesman said RJR is discussing its network-buying plans with its two main advertising firms , FCB/Leber Katz and McCann Erickson .
`` We found with the size of our media purchases that an ad agency could do just as good a job at significantly lower cost , '' said the spokesman , who declined to specify how much RJR spends on network television time .
An executive close to the company said RJR is spending about $ 140 million on network television time this year , down from roughly $ 200 million last year .
The spokesman said the broadcast unit will be disbanded Dec . 1 , and the move wo n't affect RJR 's print , radio and spot-television buying practices .
The broadcast group had been based in New York until a year ago , when RJR 's previous management moved it to Atlanta , the company 's headquarters before this summer .
One employee with the group said RJR moved 11 employees of the group back to New York in September because `` there was supposed to be a future '' .
He said the company hired three more buyers for the unit within the past two weeks , wooing them from jobs with advertising agencies .
The RJR spokesman said the company moved the 11 employees to New York last month because the group had then been in the midst of purchasing ad time for the networks ' upcoming season .
`` The studies -LSB- on closing the unit -RSB- could n't be completed until now , '' he said .
The group 's president , Peter Chrisanthopoulos , was n't in his office Friday afternoon to comment .
Citing a payment from a supplier and strong sales of certain data-storage products , Maxtor Corp . said earnings and revenue jumped in its second quarter ended Sept . 24 .
The maker of computer-data-storage products said net income rose to $ 4.8 million , or 23 cents a share , from year-earlier net of $ 1.1 million , or five cents a share .
Revenue soared to $ 117 million from $ 81.5 million .
Maxtor said its results were boosted by $ 2 million in payments received from a supplier , for a certain line of products that Maxtor is n't going to sell anymore .
Maxtor said effects from discontinuing the line may have a positive effect on future earnings and revenue .
A spokeswoman would n't elaborate , but the company said the discontinued product has never been a major source of revenue or profit .
Operationally , Maxtor benefited from robust sales of products that store data for high-end personal computers and computer workstations .
In the fiscal first half , net was $ 7 million , or 34 cents a share , up from the year-earlier $ 3.1 million , or 15 cents a share .
Revenue rose to $ 225.5 million from $ 161.8 million .
General Motors Corp . , in a series of moves that angered union officials in the U . S . and Canada , has signaled that as many as five North American assembly plants may not survive the mid-1990s as the corporation struggles to cut its excess vehicle-making capacity .
In announcements to workers late last week , GM effectively signed death notices for two full-sized van assembly plants , and cast serious doubt on the futures of three U . S . car factories .
GM is under intense pressure to close factories that became unprofitable as the giant auto maker 's U . S . market share skidded during the past decade .
The company , currently using about 80 % of its North American vehicle capacity , has vowed it will run at 100 % of capacity by 1992 .
Just a month ago , GM announced it would make an aging assembly plant in Lakewood , Ga . , the eighth U . S . assembly facility to close since 1987 .
Now , GM appears to be stepping up the pace of its factory consolidation to get in shape for the 1990s .
One reason is mounting competition from new Japanese car plants in the U . S . that are pouring out more than one million vehicles a year at costs lower than GM can match .
Another is that United Auto Workers union officials have signaled they want tighter no-layoff provisions in the new Big Three national contract that will be negotiated next year .
GM officials want to get their strategy to reduce capacity and the work force in place before those talks begin .
The problem , however , is that GM 's moves are coming at a time when UAW leaders are trying to silence dissidents who charge the union is too passive in the face of GM layoffs .
Against that backdrop , UAW Vice President Stephen P . Yokich , who recently became head of the union 's GM department , issued a statement Friday blasting GM 's `` flagrant insensitivity '' toward union members .
The auto maker 's decision to let word of the latest shutdowns and product reassignments trickle out in separate communiques to the affected plants showed `` disarray '' and an `` inability or unwillingness to provide consistent information , '' Mr . Yokich said .
GM officials told workers late last week of the following moves : Production of full-sized vans will be consolidated into a single plant in Flint , Mich .
That means two plants -- one in Scarborough , Ontario , and the other in Lordstown , Ohio -- probably will be shut down after the end of 1991 .
The shutdowns will idle about 3,000 Canadian assembly workers and about 2,500 workers in Ohio .
Robert White , Canadian Auto Workers union president , used the impending Scarborough shutdown to criticize the U.S.-Canada free trade agreement and its champion , Prime Minister Brian Mulroney .
But Canadian auto workers may benefit from a separate GM move that affects three U . S . car plants and one in Quebec .
Workers at plants in Van Nuys , Calif . , Oklahoma City and Pontiac , Mich . , were told their facilities are no longer being considered to build the next generation of the Pontiac Firebird and Chevrolet Camaro muscle cars .
GM is studying whether it can build the new Camaro-Firebird profitably at a plant in St . Therese , Quebec , company and union officials said .
That announcement left union officials in Van Nuys and Oklahoma City uncertain about their futures .
The Van Nuys plant , which employs about 3,000 workers , does n't have a product to build after 1993 .
Jerry Shrieves , UAW local president , said the facility was asked to draw up plans to continue working as a `` flex plant , '' which could build several different types of products on short notice to satisfy demand .
At the Oklahoma City plant , which employs about 6,000 workers building the eight-year-old A-body mid-sized cars , Steve Featherston , UAW local vice president , said the plant has no new product lined up , and `` none of us knows '' when the A-body cars will die .
He said he believes GM has plans to keep building A-body cars into the mid-1990s .
At Pontiac , however , the Camaro-Firebird decision appears to erase UAW hopes that GM would reopen the shuttered assembly plant that last built the plastic-bodied , two-seater Pontiac Fiero model .
The Fiero plant was viewed as a model of union-management cooperation at GM before slow sales of the Fiero forced the company to close the factory last year .
Union officials have taken a beating politically as a result .
Dissident UAW members have used the Fiero plant as a symbol of labor-management cooperation 's failure .
Investors who bought stock with borrowed money -- that is , `` on margin '' -- may be more worried than most following Friday 's market drop .
That 's because their brokers can require them to sell some shares or put up more cash to enhance the collateral backing their loans .
In October 1987 , these margin calls were thought to have contributed to the downward spiral of the stock market .
Typically , a margin call occurs when the price of a stock falls below 75 % of its original value .
If the investor does n't put up the extra cash to satisfy the call , the brokerage firm may begin liquidating the securities .
But some big brokerage firms said they do n't expect major problems as a result of margin calls .
Margin calls since Friday `` have been higher than usual , but reasonable , '' a spokesman for Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc . said .
Merrill Lynch & Co . officials `` do n't expect ( margin calls ) to be as big a factor as in 1987 '' because fewer individual investors are buying stock on margin , a spokesman said .
Hugo Quackenbush , senior vice president at Charles Schwab Corp . , the San Francisco-based discount brokerage firm , said he did n't expect any immediate problems with margin calls for Schwab customers .
He said Schwab had increased margin requirements `` so customers have more of a cushion . ''
He added : `` We learned a lesson in 1987 about volatility .

There were no major Eurobond or foreign bond offerings in Europe Friday .
It was n't so long ago that a radio network funded by the U . S . Congress -- and originally by the Central Intelligence Agency -- was accused by officials here of employing propagandists , imperialists and spies .
Now , the network has opened a news bureau in the Hungarian capital .
Employees held an open house to celebrate and even hung out a sign : `` Szabad Europa Radio '' -- Radio Free Europe .
`` I think this is a victory for the radio , '' says Barnabas de Bueky , a 55-year-old former Hungarian refugee who works in the Munich , West Germany , headquarters as deputy director of the Hungarian service .
In fact , the network hopes to set up offices in Warsaw and anywhere else in the East Bloc that will have it .
But the rapid changes brought on by glasnost and open borders are altering the network 's life in more ways than one .
In fact , Radio Free Europe is in danger of suffering from its success .
While the network currently can operate freely in Budapest , so can others .
In addition , competition for listeners is getting tougher in many ways than when broadcasting here was strictly controlled .
Instead of being denounced as an evil agent of imperialism , Radio Free Europe is more likely to draw the criticism that its programs are too tame , even boring .
`` They have a lot to do these days to compete with Hungarian radio , '' says Andrew Deak , a computer-science student at the Technical University in Budapest .
`` The Hungarian -LSB- radio -RSB- reporters seem better informed and more critical about about what 's going on here . ''
Indeed , Hungary is in the midst of a media explosion .
Boys on busy street corners peddle newspapers of every political stripe .
Newsstands are packed with a colorful array of magazines .
Radio and television are getting livelier and bolder .
The British Broadcasting Corp . and the U . S . State Department 's Voice of America broadcast over Hungarian airwaves , though only a few hours a day each in Hungarian .
Australian press magnate Rupert Murdoch has bought 50 % stakes in two popular and gossipy Hungarian newspapers , while Britain 's Robert Maxwell has let it be known here that he is thinking about similar moves .
But Radio Free Europe does n't plan to fade away .
With its mission for free speech and the capitalist way , the network 's staff says it still has plenty to do -- in Hungary and in the `` Great Eastern Beyond '' .
Radio Free Europe and its sister station for the Soviet Union , Radio Liberty , say they wo n't cut back their more than 19 hours of daily broadcasts .
They are still an important source of news for 60 million listeners in 23 exotic tongues : from Bulgarian and Belorussian to Kazakh and Kirghiz .
The establishment of its first bureau in Warsaw Pact territory shows the depth of some of the changes in Eastern Europe .
Months before the decision by the Hungarian Communist Party to rename itself Socialist and try to look more appealing to voters , the country 's rulers were trying to look more hospitable .
It proved a perfect time for Radio Free Europe to ask for permission to set up office .
Not only did the Hungarian Ministry of Foreign Affairs approve Radio Free Europe 's new location , but the Ministry of Telecommunications did something even more amazing : `` They found us four phone lines in central Budapest , '' says Geza Szocs , a Radio Free Europe correspondent who helped organize the Budapest location .
`` That is a miracle . ''
It 's a far cry from the previous treatment of the network , which had to overcome jamming of its frequencies and intimidation of local correspondents ( who filed reports to the network by phone , secret messengers or letters ) .
In fact , some of the network 's Hungarian listeners say they owe Radio Free Europe loyalty because it was responsible in many ways for keeping hope alive through what one writer here calls the `` Dark Ages of the 20th Century . ''
`` During the past four years , many of us have sat up until late at night listening to our radios , '' says the writer .
`` There were some very brave broadcasts . ''
The listeners , too , had to be brave .
Through much of the post-World War II period , listening to Western broadcasts was a crime in Hungary .
`` When we listen to the Europe station , my mother still gets nervous , '' says a Budapest translator .
`` She wants to turn down the volume and close the curtains . ''
Now , the toughest competition for Radio Free Europe comes during the late-night slot .
Hungarian radio often saves its most politically outspoken broadcasts for around midnight .
Television , which most of the time is considered rather tame , has entered the running with a new program , `` The End of the Day , '' which comes on after 11 p.m .
It is a talk show with opposition leaders and political experts who discuss Hungary 's domestic problems as well as foreign affairs .
Those who want to hear even more radical views have to get up at five on Sunday morning for `` Sunday Journal , '' on Hungarian Radio .
The competitive spirit is clearly influencing Radio Free Europe , which is trying to beef up programs .
The Budapest office plans to hire free-lance reporters to cover the latest happenings in Hungarian country towns from Nagykanizsa in the west to Nyiregyhaza in the east .
The Hungarian service has a daily 40-minute news show called Newsreel , with international and domestic news , plus a daily news review of opinions from around the world .
There 's also a host of new programs , trying to lighten up on the traditional diet of politics .
A daily 35-minute program called `` The March of Time '' tries to find interesting tidbits of lighthearted news and gossip from around the world .
There 's a program for women and a science show .
And to attract younger listeners , Radio Free Europe intersperses the latest in Western rock groups .
The Pet Shop Boys are big this year in Budapest .
`` We are starving for all the news , '' says Mr . Deak , the student .
`` Every moment we want to know everything about the world .
Matsushita Electric Industrial Co . of Japan and Siemens AG of West Germany announced they have completed a 100 million-mark ( $ 52.2 million ) joint venture to produce electronics parts .
In the venture 's first fiscal year , Siemens will hold 74.9 % of the venture and a Matsushita subsidiary , Matsushita Electronic Components Co . , 25.1 % .
A basic agreement between the two companies was announced in June .
The new company is to be called Siemens Matsushita Components G . m . b . H .
It will have its headquarters in Munich .
Matsushita 's share in the venture will rise to 35 % Oct . 1 , 1990 , and to 50 % the following Oct . 1 .
Siemens will retain majority voting rights .
The parent companies forecast sales for the venture of around 750 million marks for its first fiscal year , Matsushita said .
Sales are expected to rise to one billion marks after four years .
The company will have production facilities in West Germany , Austria , France and Spain .
Roger Rosenblatt , editor of U . S . News & World Report , resigned Friday from the weekly news magazine .
Mr . Rosenblatt said he resigned because of difficulties with commuting between his home in New York and the magazine 's editorial offices in Washington .
`` Frankly , I missed my family , '' said Mr . Rosenblatt .
In Mr . Rosenblatt 's tenure , the magazine 's advertising pages and circulation have grown significantly .
But at 2.3 million weekly paid circulation , U . S . News still ranks third behind Time Warner Inc . 's Time magazine , with 4.4 million circulation , and Washington Post Co . 's Newsweek , with 3.3 million circulation .
Mortimer B . Zuckerman , chairman and editor in chief , said Mr . Rosenblatt would be succeeded starting today by Michael Ruby , the magazine 's executive editor , and Merrill McLoughlin , a senior writer .
Mr . Ruby and Ms . McLoughlin are married to each other .
Mr . Zuckerman said his magazine would maintain its editorial format , which is a mix of analysis and trend stories with service-oriented , how-to articles .
Mr . Rosenblatt , a senior writer at Time magazine before joining U . S . News & World Report , said he had numerous job offers from other magazines while he was editor .
The offers were to work as a writer , not an editor .
He said he will now consider those offers .
Are the Dollar 's Days Numbered ?
Philippe Bacchetta and Eric van Wincoop
A year ago , the dollar bestrode the world like a colossus .
Now it is humbled and the euro looks triumphant .
Is the dollar on the way out as the world 's unchallenged reserve and trade currency ?
Or is " euro triumphalism " premature ?
That question preoccupies not only speculators tracking the dollar 's decline , but ordinary businessmen who wonder what currency to use when invoicing imports or exports .
Indeed , the part that currencies play in world trade through their role in invoicing receives too little attention .
Currently , the US dollar remains dominant .
Most US exports and imports are denominated in dollars , and the dollar is extensively used in trade that does not involve America .
Since 1980 , however , the dollar has lost ground .
Estimates from the European Commission indicate that the dollar 's share in world trade fell from 56 % in 1980 to 52 % in 1995 ( the latest year for which statistics are available ) .
The Deutsche Mark 's share remained relatively unchanged between 1980 and 1995 .
The yen lags behind , but had the highest relative growth , with its share of world trade more than doubling from 2 % in 1980 to almost 5 % in 1995 .
Among the reasons for the dollar 's longtime dominance as the premier international currency are lower transactions costs in foreign exchange markets , the historical role of the dollar in world trade since 1945 , and the sheer size of America 's economy .
But the role of size is more complex than it seems .
The second biggest economy in the world is Japan 's , but the fraction of its trade denominated in yen remains low , even when compared to the smallest European countries .
One factor that explains this is the large share of US firms in markets where Americans sell their goods .
To understand the reasons behind all this , consider what factors are in play when a firm chooses the currency it uses to invoice for goods .
Here an exporter faces two types of risk : price risk and competitiveness risk .
Consider a Japanese firm seeking to make the highest yen profits on goods sold in Switzerland .
If the Japanese firm sets the price in Swiss francs , it is exposed to price risk as the yen price will fluctuate with the yen - Swiss franc exchange rate .
This tends to make Japanese exporters prefer to price in yen .
But firms also care about what their competitors do .
If the Japanese firm sells its goods to a particular Swiss market dominated by Swiss firms ( which invoice in Swiss francs ) , it would prefer to price in Swiss francs too .
If it priced in yen , it would risk losing its market share if the yen appreciated .
If Japanese firms are dominant in a particular Swiss market , they prefer to price in yen : a Japanese firm then would not have to worry about losing market share when the yen appreciated , because its competitors would face the same pressures .
These arguments explain the big role played by the dollar in trade .
The fact that the US is large makes it more likely that US firms are dominant in a particular market , either as an exporter or as import - competitors when foreign goods are sold in America .
This implies that US firms price in dollars , whether they sell at home or abroad , and foreign firms for competitive reasons will also price in dollars when they export to the US .
Because Japan has the second largest economy in the world , the yen should be a more important currency .
Competitiveness is a key reason for why it is not .
First , the US is Japan 's largest trading partner : more than half of Japanese trade with industrialized countries is with the US .
Over 80 % of Japanese exports to the US are priced in dollars , in markets where US firms tend to dominate .
Second , even when selling to countries other than the US , Japanese exporters often face stiff American competition .
Take Japanese exports to South East Asia , which are almost 50 % denominated in dollars due to competition from US exporters .
These factors are unlikely to change soon and lead us to predict that the yen will keep a low profile in world trade .
They also explain why , over time , the euro should gain weight in international trade .
Euro - zone countries can be considered a single country when dealing with the currency denomination of trade .
This " country " has more market power than the individual countries that form the European Monetary Union .
So the euro should play a larger role in international trade in the future than the sum of the currencies it replaced .
Yet these changes will only occur gradually .
So the " euro triumphalism " that has greeted the dollar 's decline is , indeed , premature .
Despite its current distress , the dollar should retain its predominance for some time to come .

Why Wait for the Euro ?
Leszek Balcerowicz
Although the EU 's eastward enlargement has not yet happened , the debate is already shifting to ask what will follow : when should the new , predominantly postcommunist , members adopt the euro ?
Assuming that they comply with the Maastricht Treaty 's provisions concerning the EMU - and are not unfairly held to more stringent criteria - the core issue is whether new members would benefit more by waiting or whether they should seek early entry .
At the outset , it must be stressed that , in seeking earlier entry into the EMU a country assumes a more ambitious fiscal and structural program than would be needed if EMU membership is delayed .
Early entry , otherwise , would be an empty gesture .
I believe that early adoption of the euro is not only possible , but preferable to delay .
By early adoption I mean the shortest permissible period of time - two years - following a new member subordinating its monetary policy to the fiscal and monetary constraints of the exchange rate mechanism ( ERM II ) .
Assuming entry into both the EU and ERM II in 2004 , new members should aim to enter the eurozone around 2006 .
Is this realistic ?
Well , most candidate countries have already achieved a high degree of structural convergence with the EU .
Exports to the Union have soared since 1991 , when the collapse of the Soviet - era COMECON trading system forced a radical reorientation of trade - helped by massive foreign investment from the EU - towards Western markets .
Most accession candidates now send more exports to the EU than Greece , Portugal , and Spain did when they entered the EU and EMU .
Progress on disinflation is similarly impressive .
Annual inflation in most candidate countries has fallen to 4 - 5 % - not much higher than in many EU countries , and lower than in The Netherlands last year .
As with structural convergence , EU candidates already outperform Spain , Portugal , and Greece at a comparable time before their EMU debut .
Nor is there much risk of large , future corrective price swings because all but a few prices are completely liberalized .
Theoretical studies suggest that inflation in the accession countries will remain stubbornly higher than the Maastricht Treaty allows .
The culprit in this pessimistic view is the so - called " Balassa - Samuelson " effect : rapid productivity growth in the accession candidates ' tradable sectors - export manufacturing , for example - is pushing up real wages throughout their economies , including in non - tradable sectors like services .
This overall rise in real wages in the face of lower productivity growth for the service sector boosts relative prices and keeps inflation above the eurozone average .
The Balassa - Samuelson effect is still evident in Greece , Spain and Portugal .
But as empirical research prepared by the CEC5 National Banks estimates , its contribution to total price growth in the candidate countries is 1 - 2 % .
With the Balassa - Samuelson effect so subdued and limited scope for future corrective inflation , the EMU criterion regarding price stability - of annual inflation within 1.5 % of the average rate for the three best - performing economies in the EU - is within reach .
But is early admission to EMU preferable to postponing membership ?
From the standpoint of current member states , would admitting Hungary , Latvia , Poland , or Slovakia , sooner rather than later , drag down the euro as many fear ?
Fears that extending EMU to new states " too soon " would undermine the euro 's external exchange rate are irrational .
If all candidate countries join the EU at around the same time , they will together account for a mere 6 % of its total GDP .
So any negative impact on the euro from rapid accession to EMU would at worst amount to little more than a rounding error .
Delaying entry into EMU could make sense if a longer wait produced more information .
But a wait of greater length might produce nothing but added noise .
Equally , the transition period is already turbulent , with convergence - driven capital flows driving up exchange rates and complicating monetary policy in several candidate countries , including Poland , the Czech Republic , and Hungary .
Indeed , capital - flow volatility could make short work of the flexible exchange rate on offer under ERM II - a 15 % fluctuation band either side of a central parity .
Some argue that ERM II membership should be viewed as a longer - term proposition - possibly lasting until 2010 - for the benefit of candidates themselves .
The benefit is simple :
ERM II permits some exchange rate flexibility , as opposed to the fixed rates implied by adopting the euro .
This would help keep the candidates ' economic output high and thus sustain real convergence with average EU income levels .
This is an exceptionally weak argument , and a politically suspect one , too .
As European Central Bank data shows , average per capita GDP in the accession candidates is 44 % of the eurozone level .
The size of the income gap combines with the small growth differentials to imply that the process of real convergence will extend far beyond even the most cautious dates for EU and EMU entry , probably lasting several decades .
More important , long - lasting economic growth does not depend on the type of exchange rate - whether flexible or fixed ( EMU ) - while early accession will speed up crucial reforms .
A few years of limited exchange rate flexibility is a poor substitute for rapid completion of structural reforms .
In almost all candidates , further disinflation and long - term economic growth require fiscal consolidation , more flexible labor markets , and completion of privatization .
Delaying EMU entry risks weakening the incentive to complete these politically costly but necessary reforms .
Any delay in completing reforms will ultimately slow the process of real convergence that EU officials rightly hold dear .
Early adoption , by contrast , would be more conducive to these reforms , and thus to real convergence .
Success here would allow candidate countries to start reaping the benefits of greater price transparency , reduced transaction costs , and a solid macroeconomic framework .
This strategy , not one of deferred entry , promises the most for both the EU 's current and its future members .

The Fusion Myth
Sebastien Balibar
France is now rushing to construct the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor , ( ITER ) , which is supposed to show that nuclear fusion can be used to power nuclear power stations .
ITER is often presented as the long - term solution to the problem of global warming , because nuclear fusion can provide an infinite and clean source of energy .
But ITER will do nothing of the sort .
In the fission reactions that nuclear power generation relies on today , heavy elements such as uranium break into smaller ones , while in nuclear fusion small elements such as hydrogen stick together and form heavier elements ( helium ) .
Both fission and fusion produce a lot of energy .
Some political leaders explain that nuclear fusion is at work in the sun , and that , thanks to ITER , we will harness it .
They often add that , since fusion burns hydrogen , which can be found in seawater , it is an infinite source of energy .
Unfortunately , political leaders know little about the scientific issues involved .
That nuclear fusion is a source of energy has been known since the invention of the hydrogen bomb .
But its control is still a fundamental challenge for research institutes , not some minor technical difficulty that can be easily overcome .
Confining a little sun inside a box is an extremely difficult task for three main reasons .
First , the nuclear fuel is not seawater , but a mixture of the two heavy isotopes of hydrogen , deuterium and tritium , a radioactive element that has been produced in small quantities for hydrogen bombs .
Any development of fusion reactors would require producing tritium with industrial methods that have yet to be invented .
Second , the deuterium - tritium fusion reaction starts at around 100 million degrees .
To achieve this requires using a magnet to accelerate a plasma that is a big flame of deuterium and tritium nuclei .
This must be done in a ultra - high vacuum in a large chamber .
ITER is not designed to produce electricity , but to study the stability of the flame in the magnet .
Since the fusion reactions produce alpha particles , which pollute the plasma , one has to insert a " divertor " inside the flame at 100 million degrees in order to clean it .
Nobody has ever accomplished this , but ITER may be able to try around 2030 – that is , if it solves the previous problem .
Third , fusion also emits neutrons that will produce helium gas bubbles inside the wall material , which tends to explode .
The supporters of ITER explain that if the walls are porous , the bubbles can escape .
But nothing can be both leak - proof and porous , and ITER is not designed to study this contradiction .
In the future , a " blanket " should be inserted between the plasma and the walls , with two objectives : to protect the outer walls and to produce tritium from nuclear reactions within a circulating fluid containing lithium .
This might work , but the first wall of the blanket will need to be not only leak - proof and porous , but also sufficiently permeable to neutrons , which have to hit the lithium atoms beyond it .
The problem of materials is an entire research field in itself .
In order to study it , it has been decided to build the International Fusion Materials Irradiation Facility ( IFMIF ) in Japan .
Some scientists have argued that the neutron irradiation in IFMIF won ’ t be the same as in fusion reactors , but it should be noted that its cost , at one billion euros , will be one - tenth that of ITER .
So why can ’ t we wait for IFMIF ’ s results before building ITER ?
It all depends on one ’ s budget .
If ITER could really solve the planet ’ s energy problem , € 10 billion would be a negligible investment – less than the net profit of the oil company TOTAL ( € 13 billion in 2006 ) and equivalent to ten days of waging the war in Iraq .
But if fusion is ever to work in industrial power stations , it will take many decades .
Even if ITER is successful , and if one solves the tritium and material problems , everything would need to be tested in real size , and only then could a first prototype of an industrial reactor be built .
A drastic reduction of CO2 emissions is an urgent priority , but fusion is unlikely to produce sufficient energy to achieve that goal before the twenty - second century .
In fact , ITER is a big instrument for fundamental research , so its € 500 million Euros annual cost needs to be compared with similar scientific initiatives , such as the European Organization for Nuclear Research ( CERN ) , which costs one billion Swiss francs per year .
In my opinion , searching for the fundamental structure of particles is far more important than studying the stability of a plasma .
In France , the contribution to ITER is more than all the available funding for research projects in all our physics laboratories .
So the danger is that ITER will squeeze out funding for other vital research .
We already have the bad example of the International Space Station , a waste of $ 100 billion that has produced no scientific results .
ITER will not solve our energy problem .
Although it has some scientific interest in plasma physics , the participating countries should clearly state that funding it won ’ t affect the rest of their research efforts .
At the same time , the international community should support research on energy saving and storage , and accelerate the development of fourth - generation nuclear reactors , which will use fission and be both clean and durable .

Alongside the debate about the European Union constitution , a debate about European values has also developed .
This debate is important not only for implanting meaning in the constitution , but will also determine the vitality and energy of the EU itself .
The EU , being the product of several great religious and philosophical traditions , is a community of values .
The ideas of the Greeks and Romans , Christianity , Judaism , humanism , and the Enlightenment have made us who we are .
Dialogue with Islamic and Arabic cultures also helped form our identity .
The pattern of our values has been woven over hundreds of years .
Europe is the continent of Michelangelo and Montesquieu , but also of the guillotine and the gas chamber .
Indeed , the bitter experience WWII taught Europeans how fundamental is the importance of shared values .
In an impoverished , war - ravaged Europe , people yearned for peace , freedom , stability , and a new chance to prosper .
The architects of European integration - Monnet , Schuman , Adenauer , De Gasperi , and others - understood that these ideals could be achieved only by combining and interweaving the practical interests of Europe 's countries .
They built their fragile house of peace on a foundation of coal and steel .
The founders passed the torch on to the generation of Jacques Delors , Helmut Kohl , François Mitterrand , Václav Havel , Valéry Giscard d ' Estaing , and others .
They broadened and deepened European cooperation .
Their leadership made it possible for Europe to make great strides towards its post - war ideals - peace , stability , and prosperity .
We now stand at the threshold of a new phase of European cooperation .
In late October , the EU 's Constitutional Treaty will be signed .
A new generation of politicians is ready to carry the torch onwards .
But is the torch still burning bright ?
In the early 1950s , Jean Monnet wrote : " We are not forming a coalition of states .
We are uniting people . "
Apparently not .
As the Union races ahead , it seems that it has lost Europe 's citizens along the way .
Many are turning their backs on the whole project .
They have trouble seeing what is common to Europe .
They do not feel part of the great whole .
Even in the new member states , enthusiasm for the European family of democracies is cooling .
We have achieved a united Europe without uniting Europeans .
Today 's post - war generations , lacking direct memory of WWII , view Europe 's great achievements - liberty , peace , and prosperity - as a given .
The idea of Europe as a heritage and a mission does not mean much .
But , without ideals , Europe 's foundations will erode .
The emphasis on pure self - interest increases this threat .
My generation grew up with the image of Europe as an economic form of cooperation .
Political motives behind European integration were overshadowed by the economic project .
The result is an impression of Europe as a marketplace .
A Europe of markets and money , not of man and morals , dominated the project .
But without a moral foundation , there can be no free - market economy .
Today , we are paying the price for not attending to Europe 's shared values and common mission .
Until Europeans know precisely what Europe stands for , what inspires and motivates us , the Union will not be able to take joint action in the world .
The EU Constitution will make Europe more democratic and more transparent .
It provides further guarantees that decisions will be taken by those closest to citizens , and it acknowledges the significance the values on which the Union rests : respect for human rights and dignity , liberty , democracy , equality , and the rule of law .
These shared values are the glue that binds governments together in the recognition that clinging to pure self - interest is no longer reasonable when common concerns call for a common strategy .
For what is the point of doing away with Europe 's physical borders if borders between its citizens remain ?
How can Europeans be happy that the Iron Curtain is gone if individuals and groups across the Union barricade themselves behind private iron curtains ?
Indeed , fear , insecurity , and nationalism are again raising their heads .
It is important for Europeans to reflect on that as they prepare for further rounds of enlargement and consider starting accession negotiations with Turkey .
The preamble of the Constitution states that Europe is " united in its diversity . "
This may be the most concise statement of what makes Europe Europe .
But the words " united in diversity " raise the question of where this unity lies .
The answer lies in the values on which the Union is based .
They are contained in three concepts : freedom , solidarity , and mutual respect .
Croatia after Tudjman
Ivo Banac
ZAGREB :
Franjo Tudjman 's death , like his life , was a bizarre parody of Marshal Tito .
Comparisons between Tudjman and Tito , however , are undermined by anachronism .
In Tito 's day it was still possible to have strongmen in gleaming white uniforms command European states , albeit in the Balkans .
It was possible to establish authority through collectivist myths , to assert your separate road against global trends , to molest neighbors in the teeth of international censure .
No longer .
Retrograde regional satraps are outdated in a uniting Europe .
And , unlike in Tito 's time , whenever the West played Tudjman as a proxy for its interests the results were very mixed .
Tudjman probably did not wish to be independent Croatia 's Tito clone , but he could not help himself .
Tito provided the only leadership model that resonated with him .
Under the guise of democratic verbiage and a facade of democratic institutions , Tudjman promoted the monopoly of his nationalist party / movement , the HDZ .
Tudjman 's excuse was that Croatia needed to concentrate power for its struggle with Serbian aggression .
The truth is that he used a negotiated hostility with Slobodan Milosevic to solidify personal rule and a Russian - style plunder of state properties by his coterie of loyalists .
In order to accomplish this with a minimum of fuss he muzzled the press and electronic media .
Despite enmity between Serbia and Croatia , dealing dictator to dictator with Milosevic was simple .
Because both Tudjman and Milosevic believed in ethnically homogeneous states , they fomented forced population transfers ( ie , ethnic cleansing ) and a division of territory between each other .
The chief victim of their land - grab was Bosnia , which they divided and ravaged through various proxies .
The Dayton agreement represented not so much the defeat of their plans as the international legitimation of their division of Bosnia , with Bosnian Muslim enclaves left in a nervous see - saw with Tudjman 's vicious Hercegovinian minions .
The consequence of Tudjman 's policies – always projected in a harsh , bullying style – led to Croatia 's isolation from Europe and America .
It is not that Tudjman , on occasion , did not prove useful – the Croatian army 's blitzkreig in 1995 led to Dayton – but ultimately his arrogance galled more than his cooperation helped .
The tightrope turns that characterized the last several years of his encounter with the West ( threats of sanctions for non - cooperation with the Hague war crimes tribunal , holding back Western assistance – EU aid programs , Partnership for Peace , etc . ) reflect this bitter antagonism .
It would be a mistake to imagine that Tudjman 's style was entirely unrepresentative .
Croatia 's economy and traditional access to Europe could have placed it among the first candidates for European integrations had its political and social elite any notion that this was advantageous .
Instead , lack of opposition to Tudjman points to a broad consensus , in which a wink toward Western values disguises fundamental self - satisfaction with things as they are , or were .
This was not a case of mere nationalism but of a class monopoly fearing competition from outside .
Croatia 's opposition was for a long time limited to NGO 's such as the Helsinki Committee , which challenged the government on the slippery terrain of human and minority rights , an area where the parliamentary opposition kept its collective mouths shut .
In recent years , however , as the political battle shifted to the deteriorating economy , the public accepted more direct anti - Tudjman critiques , allowing parliamentary opposition to follow .
Because Tudjman created a highly - centralized political system with vast prerogatives vested in the president , the opposition 's best bet was to stick together in hope of mustering the two - thirds majority needed to change the constitution .
Unfortunately , this course was abandoned in the summer of 1998 when two opposition parties – the Social Democrats ( ex - Communists , SDP ) and the right - of - center Social Liberals ( HSLS ) – developed a special relationship that was formalized as a coalition this summer .
In response , other opposition parties , the traditional Croat Peasant Party ( HSS ) , the center - left Liberal Party ( LS ) , the populist Croat National Party ( HNS ) , and the regionalist Istrian Democratic Assembly ( IDS ) , formed their own coalition ( the Four ) .
Formally , the SDP - HSLS and the Four function as a broad opposition alliance ( the Six ) .
In fact , they are bitter rivals and will divide opposition vote at the January 3 elections for the lower house of the Parliament ( Sabor ) .
So it is risky to claim that the opposition will soon rout HDZ .
More likely , there will be ground for various coalition manoeuvres , including between parts of the opposition and HDZ .
Tudjman 's death opens the additional question of presidential elections , which must be held within 60 days after his passing .
HDZ has as many candidates as it has factions , and these are numerous .
It is possible that HDZ can win should it nominate Mate Granic , the Western - backed foreign minister .
His moderate reputation is more a matter of style than substance , but it goes a long way outside Croatia .
The question is whether key HDZ leaders prefer losing the presidency ( and that is where real power in Croatia lies ) to Granic 's ascending the throne .
As for the opposition , various presidential ambitions have been manifested , perhaps most especially those of Drazen Budisa ( HSLS ) , a former dissident and political prisoner , and his Social Democratic partner Ivica Racan , the last head of Croatia 's Communists .
It is possible that the opposition 's awkward coalition will be tested by their rival presidential dreams .
Croatia 's course will be tested by the consequences of Tudjman 's death and the forthcoming electoral rounds .
The results might be more complicated than anyone wishes .
Unless the constitution and the political system is reformed , kleptocracy checked , and relations with the West mended , Tudjman - era themes may continue .
That is a luxury that Croatia cannot afford .
Without fundamental change now , there is a real possibility of mass popular protests , and not just against Tudjman 's direct heirs .

The Myth of Inter - generational Justice
Wilfred Beckerman
OXFORD :
" Why do anything for posterity ? " is an old rhetorical question , usually followed by " after all , posterity has never done anything for us . "
This supposedly absolves us from obligations to future generations .
The opposite view is held by many social and environmental activists .
We must respect the " rights " of future generations , they say , we must take account of their interests in accordance with the dictates of some principles of justice .
The truth , as usual , lies somewhere in between .
Future generations do not have any rights , but this does not absolve us from moral constraints on those of our policies that may affect their interests .
The reason why unborn people do not have any rights is that unborn people do not have anything .
They do not have legs , or hair , or a taste for Mozart .
They are not here ; they do not exist ; period .
Unborn people should not be thought of as some special class waiting in the wings for the cue to bring them onstage .
Of course , when born these future generations will have rights .
The debate over what form these rights should take has been going on for over two millennia , so it is difficult to summarise .
Nevertheless , it can be said that the debate has been almost entirely about the rights that people have to what is available at the time , and this applies equally to future generations .
If , at any point in time , people have any moral rights at all , they are rights to what is available .
To begin with they will have basic natural rights to life and as much freedom and security to pursue whatever it is that makes their lives valuable to them as is compatible with the maximum freedom and security of others .
These " rights " may also entail secondary moral rights to a certain share of the " goods " available to society at any point .
But they have no " right " to what was , or will become , available at any other time .
For example , we may regret that we can no longer see some species of wild animal that has been hunted to extinction by people who lived centuries ago .
But we would not claim that , in doing so , they violated our " rights " .
If we have a moral " right " it must be possible for us , in principle , to insist on its being respected , or to complain to whoever has the counterpart obligation if it is not being respected , or to delegate somebody else – such as our lawyer – to claim that our rights be respected .
In practice , in many parts of the world today , these courses of action are not open to most people .
But this is because of a deficiency in their social arrangements and their political or judicial systems .
It is not a matter of logical impossibility .
Between distant generations , however , such is logically impossible .
Even in lawsuit - happy America one could not find a lawyer to represent my claim against the hunters who , three centuries ago , deprived me of the chance to see the now - extinct Dodo .
And if you have rights you must be able to waive them .
But there is no way I can say " O . K . Go ahead . Hunt the Dodo as much as you like .
I never did care much for the beasts anyway . "
If future generations lack moral " rights " it follows that they cannot be incorporated into any theory of justice .
For all theories of justice implicitly define moral rights .
But although future generations will only have rights to what is available when they are alive , decent human beings today should nevertheless be concerned about the interests that future generations will have .
To make " rights " or its related notion of " justice " the whole of morality would narrow and impoverish the very concept of morality .
The reason why most of us would be horrified by the notion of killing or injuring somebody is not that we feel that we would be depriving the person concerned of his " rights " , or that we would be violating some principle of justice .
It would be an outrageous violation of our humanitarian instincts and feelings of compassion .
For the same reason we should take into account the interests of future generations .
We should not condemn them to poverty by depriving them of some essential resource .
But the whole of history and economic theory shows that there is no danger of this happening .
Instead , our most valuable contribution to the welfare of future generations would be to bequeath to them institutions that will help them respect each others ' basic natural rights .
This work could start now , by promoting greater respect for basic human rights in those many parts of the world where they are inadequately protected .
We should also bequeath to them the best features of our culture , as well as qualities of mind and spirit , and tolerance of differences between people , that will help future generations live together peacefully and resolve their own conflicts of interest fairly and justly .
[ None of these things is a " finite " or " scarce " resource the allocation of which between generations has to be governed by some principles of inter - generational justice ] .
In other words we should shift attention away from concern with the " rights " of future generations to some allegedly scarce resources and concentrate on the non - material legacy which can add far more to the well - being of future generations than a bit more oil or whatever .
It is typical of the intellectual confusion that permeates most environmentalist thinking and is repeated parrot - like by politicians , that their emphasis on resource conservation and " sustainable development " is totally in conflict with assertions that the trouble with modern civilization is its pre - occupation with material prosperity .
It will not help future generations if they live in authoritarian regimes but have plenty of materials with which to build palaces for their rulers .

His latest book is Small is Stupid ( Duckworth , London , 1995 ) .
What are the military threats European countries now face ?
What forces are required to meet them ?
How much are governments willing to pay ?
The debate over these issues has now reached West Europe 's biggest army , Germany 's Bundeswehr .
Its outcome concerns not only Germans but their partners in Nato and the EU as well .
It is a belated debate here .
The Cold War ended a decade ago , and most of Germany 's allies conducted their debate years ago .
If Germany has lagged , it is for two reasons : Germany 's security environment has undergone the most dramatic change , and Germans remain deeply attached to military conscription .
Revolutions happen quickly but it takes time to adjust to the changes they bring .
For half - a - century , Germany was the point where the Cold War was most likely to turn hot .
Then , beginning in the spring of 1990 , Germany united , the Warsaw Pact and USSR disintegrated , and countries to Germany 's east , which had been the staging post for Soviet tank armies , suddenly became friends , then partners .
In 1994 the last Russian soldier left German soil .
That would have been the moment to take stock of Germany 's new strategic situation .
But Helmut Kohl 's government feared that any examination would unravel the central feature of the army created in the mid - 1950s and a major condition for its wide acceptance in the country : military conscription .
The military embraces conscription because it assures the armed forces of high - quality recruits and a close link to civil society ; politicians like it because it helps make the armed forces transparent ; agencies of the welfare state appreciate it because , without conscription , there would be no conscientious objectors to be usefully ( and cheaply ) employed in all sorts of social tasks .
So the armed forces found themselves in a double bind : the Cold War 's end prompted calls for a peace dividend and for unification to be funded .
Germany 's defense budget slid to lower levels even faster than did those of her allies .
But to maintain conscription implied a large and costly military structure which bloated personal expenditure at the price of squeezing the budget share of military investment .
The result is an army neither manned nor equipped for dealing with likely security threats , nor for cooperating with the armed forces of Germany 's allies .
So reform became inevitable .
Because the conservatives of Helmut Kohl did not address it , Gerhard Schroeder 's left coalition had to .
A year ago , it set up an independent " Commission on Common Security and the Future of the Armed Forces " under the chairmanship of Richard von Weizsaecker , the respected former President of the Republic .
Earlier this week , the Commission 's report was published .
A debate long in coming is finally beginning .
The 179 page document does not mince words .
The Bundeswehr has no future in its current structure .
Germany is no longer threatened by invading armies ; she is surrounded by allies in Nato and partners in the EU .
This strategic condition is here to stay .
Instead of the capability for repulsing a massive attack on its borders , the armed forces need to be able to intervene in and manage crises B whether within or beyond Nato B in joint operations with their closest allies .
Hence what counts is the number and equipment of forces deployable for crisis operations .
At the moment , barely sixty thousand soldiers qualify ; the Weizsaecker Commission calls for an increase to 140 , 000 of different stages of readiness , sufficient to intervene in two simultaneous crises .
At the same time , it proposes a drastic reduction in the overall size of the Bundeswehr : from the current 320 , 000 to no more than 240 , 000 men and women ( yes , women : they will be eligible for practically all military functions ) .
The number of conscripts , with a military service of 10 months , should be 30 , 000 a year , down from the present 130 , 000 .
In other words : the number of soldiers needed for the new tasks goes up , while the total of the armed forces goes down .
The resulting savings are proposed to modernize military hardware and equip the forces for future tasks .
Just as soldiers and their means should be geared to these , so the chain of command needs to be streamlined to assure rapid deployment of combined forces , in close coordination with allies , and with political oversight guaranteed .
It will take up to six years , the Commission estimates , to manage the transition from the present to the future Bundeswehr , and Weizsäcker suggests a program budget to make sure the reform stays on course .
But if it does , Germany will be fully capable of honoring commitments she has undertaken in Nato and the EU .
Indeed , the reform will give a boost to much closer European defence cooperation by increasing interoperability with major European allies and encouraging joint procurement , joint production and joint management of military investment .
Now politicians are taking over .
In the ensuing public debate , two items have already emerged as central : money and conscription B one politically demanding , the other politically convenient .
These reforms will not come cheap .
Although the new Bundeswehr will be more cost - efficient , it will need money to manage the changeover , more than currently planned by a government set on a laudable course of fiscal consolidation .
Will Chancellor Schroeder be willing to commit himself to reforms which will bring fruit only after the next elections ?
Conscription is another matter .
While one third of the Commission members favored a volunteer army , the majority supported conscription , albeit with a smaller number of call - ups than today .
Their reasoning : Since the future is uncertain , it makes sense to retain the flexibility conscription permits , to respond both to unforeseen changes in the security environment and to shortfalls in the recruitment of volunteers ; here the difficulties that allied armies are encountering which have jettisoned conscription have been a warning .
But the number of young men to be called up depends on the requirements of the forces ; hence the Commission insists on no less than ten months ' service . This explains the much reduced figure of only 30.000 a year .
It is this part of the proposal which is encountering most criticism .
Most political parties reject it , preferring instead to draft a much higher number .
Nato 's Next Moves East
BERLIN : Nato 's next summit will take place in Prague in the winter of 2002 – that is , if President Bush does n't call his allies together before then .
But the questions to be answered leading up to the summit are already clear : which , if any , country will be asked to join Nato ; when will any new member join ?
Whatever decisions are taken , it is also clear that preparatory work must begin as soon as possible , and at least before the end of the year .
All this is different from 1997 , when Poland , Hungary and the Czech Republic joined Nato .
Back then , the outcome of the Madrid summit that agreed to their membership was uncertain until the final moments .
That uncertainty ended when America succeeded in limiting invitations to three chosen countries , surprising those Alliance members who supported other candidates .
Today , the most important issue facing Nato concerns whether or not to admit the Baltic states – Estonia , Latvia , and Lithuania – now , after some delay , or never .
Turning down or delaying Baltic state membership will be seen as a concession to Russia ; acting in their favor will be regarded by Moscow as a slap - in - the - face .
No matter what decision Nato takes , containing the negative fall - out – in Russia or the Baltics – will not be easy .
So a surprise conclusion in the manner of Madrid will only make matters worse , because careful preparations will be needed to contain the damage , and too much time will be lost if everything is put off until the meeting in Prague .
Some Nato members hope to evade these problems altogether through delay .
Why not postpone enlargement , they ask , until some of the states demanding to join Nato have gained EU membership , where elements of their security concerns may be met ?
But postponement is not a viable option , for the following reasons :
- Russia itself placed membership for the Baltic three atop Nato 's agenda .
Time and again Moscow has thundered that Nato 's first eastward enlargement must be its last .
Bringing the Baltic states into Nato , Russia claims , would severely compromise its security ( for that read Russian self - esteem ) .
The strength of these protests , however , will make dawdling over Nato enlargement appear as a kowtow to President Putin ;
- The West promised to continue enlargement at the Washington Summit of April 1999 .
Back then Nato heads - of - state welcomed the progress of various candidate countries , commending the Baltic states in particular .
Nato 's leaders also promised to revisit enlargement by 2002 at the latest .
So they cannot repeat the same formula in Prague and remain credible in both Russia and Eastern Europe ;
- EU enlargement takes time while Nato enlargement is relatively speedy .
Were negotiations over EU - admission of the Baltics near conclusion , postponing Nato - membership could be justified because the EU , with its new defense identity , is now both a security and prosperity union .
As EU members , the Baltic states would indirectly come under Nato 's security shield , making explicit membership unnecessary perhaps .
Unfortunately , years will elapse before negotiations over EU membership will conclude and be ratified .
Stalling until that time is postponement by other means .
- At the Cold War 's end , Nato redefined itself as a stability network for all the Euro - Atlantic community , which includes Eastern Europe 's new democracies .
Arguments which say that , because no direct security risk exists there is no need for a Nato guarantee of the Baltics – a view that sometimes gains attention in Berlin – break with this redefinition .
Even if some Nato members want to distance themselves from this strategy , the Bush Administration unambiguously supports Nato 's role as a stability network .
Neither putative EU membership nor today 's favorable security conditions justify postponing enlargement .
Diplomatic tricks cannot finesse the issue .
Nato must either say " Yes " or " No " to the Baltic states .
( To be precise , Nato must treat the applications of all three Baltic countries together .
If only one were invited to join as a symbol of western determination , Russia would interpret this as appeasement , not steadfastness )
If Nato says " Yes " to the Baltics , it must make both Moscow and the Baltic three understand that enlargement is meant to increase stability along Russia 's western border , not threaten Russia .
As a signal to both , Nato 's military presence in the Baltics should be kept to a minimum .
In addition , the prospect of a democratic Russia eventually joining Nato might be openly acknowledged .
Both must be done before any new enlargement is announced .
If Nato rejects the Baltic states it will need to prevent Moscow from interpreting that decision as confirmation that Estonia , Latvia , and Lithuania remain locked within Russia 's sphere of influence and that its Great Power posturing has paid off .
Both inferences are potentially disastrous , not only for relations between West and Eastern Europe but , more importantly , for relations between Russia and the West .
Russia must be persuaded to confirm – explicitly and formally – the right of the Baltics , on their own , to choose their allies .
In view of Moscow 's insistence that it will never accept such a decision , this will not be easy .
Moreover , if Nato membership for the Baltics is rejected , they will need reassurance that the West will assist them , concretely , should their security be put at risk .
Admission or postponement are both legitimate decisions .
But each will require considerable early efforts to reduce their fall - out .
In weighing these options , admission of the Baltic countries quickly seems the better solution .
Efforts to contain the damage caused by postponement will likely be far more demanding than any effort needed to ease tension after enlargement is announced .
Moreover , at the next Summit following Prague , the Baltics must be at any rate be granted what , in view of their history , they have every right to demand : to be part of a stability alliance that is a matter of course for western democracies .

The Crisis of the Left
Olivier Blanchard
After a series of electoral losses around the world , the left is in crisis .
To restore it to health , some on the left argue for a return to their parties ' historical roots .
Others argue that the old myths should be abandoned in favor of a bold move forward .
This debate is occurring not only in France after the defeat of the Socialists last April .
It also characterizes the political situation in the US after the defeat of the Democrats in last November 's mid - term elections .
Both parties face the same dilemma , and this is precisely my point : that the crisis confronting the left is a deep , fundamental , one .
In the past , the left was equipped with its own ideology , its own economic theory .
The fundamental economic mechanism that determined how the world worked was the struggle for rents between workers and capitalists .
With this " us versus them " view of the world , it was not hard to rally voters , from the most disenfranchised all the way up to the salaried middle class - - more than enough for the left to secure electoral majorities .
But the world has changed , and the left 's old view simply no longer applies .
More intense competition , within and across countries , has decreased the available rents .
Financial capital can cross borders far more easily , and physical capital can relocate almost as quickly .
The limits on redistribution through the market are much tighter : trying to appropriate the rents may lead firms to move to emerging countries , or else to go bankrupt .
This reality has taken a while to sink in , and a number of parties on the left still cannot bring themselves to acknowledge the constraints imposed by market forces .
Some do , of course , none more explicitly than the UK 's Labor Party , led by Tony Blair .
Others , typically old - line communist parties , have retained much of their traditional rhetoric , but this is largely for electoral consumption .
They know all too well that the old nemesis , " capital , " has become difficult or impossible to expropriate , yet they remain unready or unwilling to deliver the news to their constituency .
The same tension exists within parties themselves .
Witness the muddled debate within the French Socialist party in the aftermath of its defeat , with the " left of the left " and the " right of the left " in a fight for control both of the party and the route by which it should eventually return to power .
And yet both available strategies - - doing nothing or attempting to modernize - - have obvious pitfalls .
The old rhetoric , after all , still resonates powerfully with the most destitute parts of the electorate : minimum wage workers , the long - term unemployed , and all those who feel that anything would be better than what they have now .
It also allows easier contact with fringe groups , such as anti - globalization protesters and the most zealous greens .
But while the old religion still mobilizes the left , it makes it difficult to hold the center .
The middle class has lost its faith in the old rhetoric , and wherever the left , by some chance , comes to power , reality quickly sinks in .
Modernization runs into the opposite problems .
Public discussion of new ways to finance retirement pension plans , or of introducing a negative income tax , sounds sweet to economists of all stripes , but it does not exactly mobilize public opinion .
The poor do n't care .
The extreme left becomes disenfranchised .
The middle class likes the tone , but wonders how different the program is from what they hear from the neo - liberal right .
As the events of the French elections last spring demonstrated , when this dynamic prevails , the left loses the elections .
Shift everything I just said regarding this strategic dilemma to the right a bit and you arrive at the problems of America 's Democrats .
The choice of a candidate for the next elections is about this strategic choice , not personalities .
Shift everything a bit to the left , and you arrive at the problems facing President Lula Ignacio da Silva in Brazil .
Should he return to the old Lula rhetoric and watch capital flee the country , or try " modernity " and disappoint many of those who voted for him ?
With minor adjustments , the left in Germany , Italy , Spain , Portugal , and so on faces the same Hobson 's choice .
So : Damned if you do ; damned if you do n't ?
No , or at least not quite .
The fundamental feature that must distinguish the left and the right is not their respective views on the economy , but rather their stances regarding redistribution .
One of the first lessons of economics is that there is a trade - off between efficiency and redistribution .
The right focuses on efficiency .
The left emphasizes redistribution .
A clear commitment to the poor , the sick , and the unfortunate must be the message of the left .
And the means , however " boring . " must be appropriate to realizing this commitment : a combination of sustainable retirement systems , better designed unemployment benefit systems , negative income taxes , training programs , and the like .
Only by employing the rhetoric of commitment to mobilize the troops while devoting careful attention to the center 's concern with methods can the left hope to return to power .

Japan Is n't Doomed
Magnus Blomstrom
TOKYO / STOCKHOLM : Pessimism about Japan is easy and pervasive nowadays .
Its financial crisis drags on , growth is nil , unemployment rises , and , recently , deflation appeared .
Is there any way out ?
For a Swede , Japan 's economic problems are a form of déja vu .
In 1992 , Swedes accepted that their " Swedish Model " did n't work .
This was hard to understand , because everything had gone so well in Sweden for so long .
With an economy falling apart and a bankrupt financial sector , radical reforms were needed .
Change began in banking .
Sweden 's experience suggests that Japan 's most urgent problem is its financial crisis .
As in Sweden 8 years ago , there is too much bad debt and too many banks .
Insolvency in the financial sector spills into other sectors in the form of a credit crunch , because Japanese banks are unwilling to lend money .
This type of financial crisis is not unique to Japan .
Countries where land and stock prices rose and fell dramatically also experienced similar crisis .
America in the 1930 's and 1980 's had banking crisis of this sort which had real economic effects .
So , also , Sweden in the early 1990s .
Sweden 's crisis is a case for Japan to study , not only because it was similar , but also because Sweden solved it .
Just as Japan has done , Sweden 's government took over most bad loans from private banks so that they could begin operating more normally .
In contrast to Japan , however , Sweden simultaneously restructured the entire banking sector by closing down inefficient banks .
Restructuring was crucial to revitalizing Sweden 's financial sector , and is necessary in Japan .
Quick , forceful restructuring will help end the credit crunch and lay the base for renewed growth .
Longer term , a closer look at Japanese demographic trends is crucial .
Japan recently achieved the longest life expectancy of all countries .
One - third of Japanese will be over 65 years of age in 2040 , double 1995 's level .
Simultaneously , fertility rates dropped to 1.4 per woman .
These demographic influences will incite severe labor shortages early in the 21st century , just when an aging population places severe pressure on health and welfare facilities .
Japan will likely experience a slowing in its traditionally high savings rate as its population ages .
This implies a dramatic slowdown in investment and long - term growth rates unless offsetting increases in productivity emerge .
Throughout history , however , Japan confronted big challenges by restructuring its culture and economy .
To revitalize Japan 's economy in the long run , three big adjustments are necessary .
Liberalization of labor markets and greater inclusion of women in the workforce must occur .
Conventional wisdom says that low unemployment and job turnover rates , attributable to a system of ‘ life - time employment ' and worker devotion to their firms , contributed to Japan 's rapid postwar growth .
Firms invested heavily in worker education , which focused on providing broad exposure to manufacturing activities , increasing productivity , and firm - specific innovations .
The need for narrowly specialized firm - specific workers is disappearing as service sectors like telecommunications , computers , software , and finance expand .
So the need for broad - based , firm - specific worker training in manufacturing will shrink .
In response to increasing labor shortages , the 21st century will bring new roles for Japanese women .
Women have traditionally been underutilized given their education levels .
While the increase in women in the labor force has recently been rapid , female employment is only 50 % in Japan ( relative to almost 80 % amongst men ) .
A second structural adjustment concerns regulatory reform .
Japan 's economy has been marked by high government involvement and regulation in most industries .
Japan 's postwar development strategy relied on a public - private partnership .
The government sought to modernize the economic base by selecting and nurturing promising industries - limiting competition , supporting research and development and technology transfers , and encouraging the extension of credit .
Industries with potential to achieve economies of scale and scope were most favored and permitted to form horizontal and vertical cartels that cooperated on pricing , R &amp; D , production , etc .
The government also protected special interests , such as rice farmers and small retailers , against competition through a complex system of licensing , regulation , and quality controls .
Close partnership between business and government is in direct contrast to the western , particularly the American , model grounded in strong antitrust policy , competition , and private ownership .
Japan viewed this approach as wasteful , with firms using real resources to drive others out of business or duplicate R &amp; D costs .
In the face of a stagnant economy and an integrated global economy , Japan is under increasing pressure to modify its regulatory framework and promote competition .
Japan 's regulatory environment must converge toward the industrial policies of other advanced nations .
This has been the case across Europe during the 1980s and 1990s .
These reforms will create new markets , stimulate competition , attract foreign investment and technology transfers , and improve consumer interests .
I tried to examine myself .
I felt my pulse .
I could not at first feel any pulse at all .
Then , all of a sudden , it seemed to start off .
I pulled out my watch and timed it .
I made it a hundred and forty - seven to the minute .
I tried to feel my heart .
I could not feel my heart .
It had stopped beating .
I have since been induced to come to the opinion that it must have been there all the time , and must have been beating , but I cannot account for it .
I patted myself all over my front , from what I call my waist up to my head , and I went a bit round each side , and a little way up the back .
But I could not feel or hear anything .
I tried to look at my tongue .
I stuck it out as far as ever it would go , and I shut one eye , and tried to examine it with the other .
I could only see the tip , and the only thing that I could gain from that was to feel more certain than before that I had scarlet fever .
I had walked into that reading - room a happy , healthy man .
I crawled out a decrepit wreck .
I went to my medical man .
He is an old chum of mine , and feels my pulse , and looks at my tongue , and talks about the weather , all for nothing , when I fancy I ' m ill ;
so I thought I would do him a good turn by going to him now .
" What a doctor wants , " I said , " is practice .
He shall have me .
He will get more practice out of me than out of seventeen hundred of your ordinary , commonplace patients , with only one or two diseases each . "
So I went straight up and saw him , and he said : " Well , what 's the matter with you ? "
I said : " I will not take up your time , dear boy , with telling you what is the matter with me .
Life is brief , and you might pass away before I had finished .
But I will tell you what is NOT the matter with me .
I have not got housemaid 's knee .
Why I have not got housemaid 's knee , I cannot tell you ; but the fact remains that I have not got it .
Everything else , however , I HAVE got . "
And I told him how I came to discover it all .
Then he opened me and looked down me , and clutched hold of my wrist , and then he hit me over the chest when I was n't expecting it - a cowardly thing to do , I call it - and immediately afterwards butted me with the side of his head .
After that , he sat down and wrote out a prescription , and folded it up and gave it me , and I put it in my pocket and went out .
I did not open it .
I took it to the nearest chemist 's , and handed it in .
The man read it , and then handed it back .
He said he did n't keep it .
I said : " You are a chemist ? "
He said : " I am a chemist .
If I was a co - operative stores and family hotel combined , I might be able to oblige you .
Being only a chemist hampers me . "
I read the prescription .
It ran : " 1 lb . beefsteak , with 1 pt . bitter beer every 6 hours .
1 ten - mile walk every morning .
1 bed at 11 sharp every night .
And do n't stuff up your head with things you do n't understand . "
I followed the directions , with the happy result - speaking for myself - that my life was preserved , and is still going on .
In the present instance , going back to the liver - pill circular , I had the symptoms , beyond all mistake , the chief among them being " a general disinclination to work of any kind . "
What I suffer in that way no tongue can tell .
From my earliest infancy I have been a martyr to it .
For the next eight or ten months , Oliver was the victim of a systematic course of treachery and deception .
He was brought up by hand .
The hungry and destitute situation of the infant orphan was duly reported by the workhouse authorities to the parish authorities .
The parish authorities inquired with dignity of the workhouse authorities , whether there was no female then domiciled in " the house " who was in a situation to impart to Oliver Twist , the consolation and nourishment of which he stood in need .
The workhouse authorities replied with humility , that there was not .
Upon this , the parish authorities magnanimously and humanely resolved , that Oliver should be " farmed " , or , in other words , that he should be despatched to a branch - workhouse some three miles off , where twenty or thirty other juvenile offenders against the poor - laws , rolled about the floor all day , without the inconvenience of too much food or too much clothing , under the parental superintendence of an elderly female , who received the culprits at and for the consideration of sevenpence - halfpenny per small head per week .
Sevenpence - halfpenny 's worth per week is a good round diet for a child ; a great deal may be got for sevenpence - halfpenny , quite enough to overload its stomach , and make it uncomfortable .
The elderly female was a woman of wisdom and experience ; she knew what was good for children ; and she had a very accurate perception of what was good for herself .
So , she appropriated the greater part of the weekly stipend to her own use , and consigned the rising parochial generation to even a shorter allowance than was originally provided for them .
Thereby finding in the lowest depth a deeper still ; and proving herself a very great experimental philosopher .
Everybody knows the story of another experimental philosopher who had a great theory about a horse being able to live without eating , and who demonstrated it so well , that he got his own horse down to a straw a day , and would unquestionably have rendered him a very spirited and rampacious animal on nothing at all , if he had not died , four - and - twenty hours before he was to have had his first comfortable bait of air .
Unfortunately for the experimental philosophy of the female to whose protecting care Oliver Twist was delivered over , a similar result usually attended the operation of her system ; for at the very moment when a child had contrived to exist upon the smallest possible portion of the weakest possible food , it did perversely happen in eight and a half cases out of ten , either that it sickened from want and cold , or fell into the fire from neglect , or got half - smothered by accident ;
in any one of which cases , the miserable little being was usually summoned into another world , and there gathered to the fathers it had never known in this .
Occasionally , when there was some more than usually interesting inquest upon a parish child who had been overlooked in turning up a bedstead , or inadvertently scalded to death when there happened to be a washing - - - though the latter accident was very scarce , anything approaching to a washing being of rare occurrence in the farm - - - the jury would take it into their heads to ask troublesome questions , or the parishioners would rebelliously affix their signatures to a remonstrance .
But these impertinences were speedily checked by the evidence of the surgeon , and the testimony of the beadle ; the former of whom had always opened the body and found nothing inside ( which was very probable indeed ) , and the latter of whom invariably swore whatever the parish wanted ; which was very self - devotional .
Besides , the board made periodical pilgrimages to the farm , and always sent the beadle the day before , to say they were going .
The children were neat and clean to behold , when they went ; and what more would the people have !
It cannot be expected that this system of farming would produce any very extraordinary or luxuriant crop .
Oliver Twist 's ninth birth - day found him a pale thin child , somewhat diminutive in stature , and decidedly small in circumference .
But nature or inheritance had implanted a good sturdy spirit in Oliver 's breast .
It had had plenty of room to expand , thanks to the spare diet of the establishment ; and perhaps to this circumstance may be attributed his having any ninth birth - day at all .
Be this as it may , however , it was his ninth birth - day ; and he was keeping it in the coal - cellar with a select party of two other young gentlemen , who , after participating with him in a sound thrashing , had been locked up for atrociously presuming to be hungry , when Mrs . Mann , the good lady of the house , was unexpectedly startled by the apparition of Mr . Bumble , the beadle , striving to undo the wicket of the garden - gate .
" Goodness gracious !
Is that you , Mr . Bumble , sir ? "
said Mrs . Mann , thrusting her head out of the window in well - affected ecstasies of joy .
" ( Susan , take Oliver and them two brats up stairs , and wash ' em directly . )
My heart alive ! Mr . Bumble , how glad I am to see you , surely ! "
Now , Mr . Bumble was a fat man , and a choleric ; so , instead of responding to this open - hearted salutation in a kindred spirit , he gave the little wicket a tremendous shake , and then bestowed upon it a kick which could have emanated from no leg but a beadle 's .
" Lor , only think , " said Mrs . Mann , running out , - - - for the three boys had been removed by this time , - - - " only think of that !
That I should have forgotten that the gate was bolted on the inside , on account of them dear children !
Walk in , sir ; walk in , pray , Mr . Bumble , do , sir . "
Although this invitation was accompanied with a curtsey that might have softened the heart of a churchwarden , it by no means mollified the beadle .
" Do you think this respectful or proper conduct , Mrs . Mann , " inquired Mr . Bumble , grasping his cane , " to keep the parish officers a waiting at your garden - gate , when they come here upon porochial business connected with the porochial orphans ?
Are you aweer , Mrs . Mann , that you are , as I may say , a porochial delegate , and a stipendiary ? "
" I ' m sure , Mr . Bumble , that I was only a telling one or two of the dear children as is so fond of you , that it was you a coming , " replied Mrs . Mann with great humility .
Mr . Bumble had a great idea of his oratorical powers and his importance .
He had displayed the one , and vindicated the other .
He relaxed .
" Well , well , Mrs . Mann , " he replied in a calmer tone ; " it may be as you say ; it may be .
Lead the way in , Mrs . Mann , for I come on business , and have something to say . "
Mrs . Mann ushered the beadle into a small parlour with a brick floor ; placed a seat for him ; and officiously deposited his cocked hat and cane on the table before him .
Mr . Bumble wiped from his forehead the perspiration which his walk had engendered , glanced complacently at the cocked hat , and smiled .
Yes , he smiled .
Beadles are but men ; and Mr . Bumble smiled .
" Now do n't you be offended at what I ' m a going to say , " observed Mrs . Mann , with captivating sweetness .
" You ' ve had a long walk , you know , or I would n't mention it .
Now , will you take a little drop of somethink , Mr . Bumble ? "
" Not a drop . Not a drop , " said Mr . Bumble , waving his right hand in a dignified , but placid manner .
" I think you will , " said Mrs . Mann , who had noticed the tone of the refusal , and the gesture that had accompanied it .
" Just a leetle drop , with a little cold water , and a lump of sugar . "
The haggling business , which had mainly depended on the horse , became disorganized forthwith .
Distress , if not penury , loomed in the distance .
Durbeyfield was what was locally called a slack - twisted fellow ;
he had good strength to work at times ; but the times could not be relied on to coincide with the hours of requirement ; and , having been unaccustomed to the regular toil of the day labourer , he was not particularly persistent when they did so coincide .
Tess , meanwhile , as the one who had dragged her parents into this quagmire , was silently wondering what she could do to help them out of it ; and then her mother broached her scheme .
" We must take the ups with the downs , Tess , " said she ; " and never could your high blood have been found out at a more called for moment .
You must try your friends .
Do ye know that there is a very rich Mrs d ' Urberville living on the outskirts o ' The Chase , who must be our relation ?
You must go to her and claim kin , and ask for some help in our trouble . "
" I should n't care to do that , " says Tess .
" If there is such a lady , ' would be enough for us if she were friendly - not to expect her to give us help . "
" You could win her round to do anything , my dear .
Besides , perhaps there 's more in it than you know of .
I ' ve heard what I ' ve heard , good now . "
The oppressive sense of the harm she had done led Tess to be more deferential than she might otherwise have been to the maternal wish ; but she could not understand why her mother should find such satisfaction in contemplating an enterprise of , to her , such doubtful profit .
Her mother might have made inquiries , and have discovered that this Mrs d ' Urberville was a lady of unequalled virtues and charity .
But Tess 's pride made the part of poor relation one of particular distaste to her .
" I ' d rather try to get work , " she murmured .
" Durbeyfield , you can settle it , " said his wife , turning to where he sat in the background .
" If you say she ought to go , she will go . "
" I do n't like my children going and making themselves beholden to strange kin , " murmured he .
" I ' m the head of the noblest branch o ' the family , and I ought to live up to it . "
His reasons for staying away were worse to Tess than her own objection to going .
" Well , as I killed the horse , mother , " she said mournfully , " I suppose I ought to do something .
I do n't mind going and seeing her , but you must leave it to me about asking for help .
And do n't go thinking about her making a match for me - it is silly . "
" Very well said , Tess ! " observed her father sententiously .
" Who said I had such a thought ? " asked Joan .
" I fancy it is in your mind , mother .
But I 'll go . "
Rising early next day she walked to the hill - town called Shaston , and there took advantage of a van which twice in the week ran from Shaston eastward to Chaseborough , passing near Trantridge , the parish in which the vague and mysterious Mrs d ' Urberville had her residence .
Tess Durbeyfield 's route on this memorable morning lay amid the northeastern undulations of the Vale in which she had been born , and in which her life had unfolded .
The Vale of Blackmoor was to her the world , and its inhabitants the races thereof .
From the gates and stiles of Marlott she had looked down its length in the wondering days of infancy , and what had been mystery to her then was not much less than mystery to her now .
She has seen daily from her chamber - window towers , villages , faint white mansions ; above all the town of Shaston standing majestically on its height ; its windows shining like lamps in the evening sun .
She had hardly ever visited the place , only a small tract even of the Vale and its environs being known to her by close inspection .
Much less had she been far outside the valley .
Every contour of the surrounding hills was as personal to her as that of her relatives ' faces ; but for what lay beyond her judgment was dependent on the teaching of the village school , where she had held a leading place at the time of her leaving , a year or two before this date .
In those early days she had been much loved by others of her own sex and age , and had used to be seen about the village as one of three - all nearly of the same year - walking home from school side by side ;
Tess the middle one - in a pink print pinafore , of a finely reticulated pattern , worn over a stuff frock that had lost its original colour for a nondescript tertiary - marching on upon long stalky legs , in tight stockings which had little ladder - like holes at the knees , torn by kneeling in the roads and banks in search of vegetable and mineral treasures ; her then earth - coloured hair hanging like pot - hooks ;
the arms of the two outside girls resting round the waist of Tess ; her arms on the shoulders of the two supporters .
As Tess grew older , and began to see how matters stood , she felt quite a Malthusian towards her mother for thoughtlessly giving her so many little sisters and brothers , when it was such a trouble to nurse and provide for them .
Her mother 's intelligence was that of a happy child : Joan Durbeyfield was simply an additional one , and that not the eldest , to her own long family of waiters on Providence .
However , Tess became humanely beneficent towards the small ones , and to help them as much as possible she used , as soon as she left school , to lend a hand at hay making or harvesting on neighbouring farms ; or , by preference , at milking or butter - making processes , which she had learnt when her father had owned cows ; and being deft - fingered it was a kind of work in which she excelled .
Every day seemed to throw upon her young shoulders more of the family burdens , and that Tess should be the representative of the Durbeyfields at the d ' Urberville mansion came as a thing of course .
In this instance it must be admitted that the Durbeyfields were putting their fairest side outward .
She alighted from the van at Trantridge Cross , and ascended on foot a hill in the direction of the district known as The Chase , on the borders of which , as she had been informed , Mrs d ' Urberville 's seat , The Slopes , would be found .
It was not a manorial home in the ordinary sense , with fields , and pastures , and a grumbling farmer , out of whom the owner had to squeeze an income for himself and his family by hook or by crook .
It was more , far more ; a country house built for enjoyment pure and simple , with not an acre of troublesome land attached to it beyond what was required for residential purposes , and for a little fancy farm kept in hand by the owner , and tended by a bailiff .
The crimson brick lodge came first in sight , up to its eaves in dense evergreens .
Snow fell softly onto the wooden and stone houses of Oberndorf , an Austrian village near Salzburg .
Inside , villagers decorated freshly hewn spruce trees with candles , fruit and nuts as they prepared for the holiest of nights .
Soon bells would peal from Oberndorf 's modest church to announce midnight Mass , and the faithful would celebrate the birth of Christ with prayer and song .
Within the Church of St . Nicholas , however , the mood was hardly one of joy that Christmas Eve afternoon in 1818 .
Curate Joseph Mohr , 26 , had just discovered that the organ was badly damaged .
No matter how hard the pedals were pumped , he could coax only a scratchy wheeze from the ancient instrument .
Mohr was desperate .
By the time a repairman could reach the parish , Christmas would be long over .
To the young curate , a Christmas without music was unthinkable .
Mohr had a natural instinct for music .
As a boy , the illegitimate son of a seamstress and a soldier , he had earned money singing and playing the violin and guitar in public .
At school , and then at the university , he lived on money he earned as a performer .
His hard work and talent caught the attention of a clergyman who persuaded Mohr to enter the seminary .
Ordained a priest in 1815 , Mohr was posted to Oberndorf in 1817 .
There , he not only preached the Psalms , but surprised some of his congregation by strumming a guitar , switching easily from folk music to hymns .
Now , faced with a Christmas crisis , the young cleric withdrew to the quiet of his study .
Realizing that the traditional Christmas carols would not sound right on a guitar , he decided to produce a new song .
Bending over a sheet of blank paper , his quill pen poised , he thought about a parish family he had recently visited to bless their newborn child .
The memory of that mother holding her infant wrapped snugly against the winter cold took Mohr 's thoughts to another modest birth almost two thousand years earlier .
Tentatively , he began writing .
His pen moved as if guided by an invisible hand .
A haunting refrain , " Stille Nacht , heilige Nacht ! " appeared on the paper : " Silent night , holy night . "
In phrases as simple as a children 's poem , the young curate told of the Christmas miracle in six stanzas .
It was as if the words flowed directly from heaven .
Time was growing short when he finished .
The verses still had to be set to music in time for midnight Mass .
Mohr decided to seek out his good friend Franz Xaver Gruber , 31 , the schoolmaster at nearby Arnsdorf , and a more skilled composer than he was .
Unlike Mohr , Gruber had had to hide his passion for music .
To his strict father , a weaver , music was not a suitable profession for putting bread on the table .
So in the evening , Franz would creep out of the house to take music lessons from the local schoolmaster .
He did so well that when his father heard him playing the organ one day , the elder Gruber relented and let his son study music .
Franz decided to become a teacher as well .
In those days a schoolmaster was expected to serve as organist and choirmaster at a local church .
Sent to Arnsdorf to teach , Gruber had been welcomed at neighboring St . Nicholas .
That Christmas Eve , according to historians who pieced together the story , Mohr visited Gruber and his large family at their modest living quarters above the school .
Mohr told his friend of his dilemma .
Handing over his newly written words , Mohr asked Gruber whether he could compose a tune to fit them , suitable for two voices , chorus and guitar , and in time for midnight Mass .
As Gruber read Father Mohr 's words , he was surely struck by their beauty and innocence .
He went to his piano to begin work while Mohr returned to his church .
Drawing on three of the most basic harmonies in the musical repertoire , the organist wove a plain , hauntingly evocative melody .
Then he took it to Father Mohr late that evening .
With barely time for a rehearsal , the two men agreed that Mohr would play his guitar and sing tenor while Gruber sang bass .
Following each stanza , the church chorus would chime in on the refrain .
At midnight , parishioners filed in , probably expecting the organ to fill the church with the resounding notes of Christmas hymns .
Instead , the building was silent as they crowded into the narrow wooden pews .
Father Mohr stepped into the nave and beckoned the schoolmaster to stand by his side .
Holding his guitar , the curate must have explained to the assembled flock that , although the organ was broken , the midnight Mass would include music nonetheless : he and Gruber had prepared a special Christmas song for the congregation .
With Mohr strumming the guitar , two mellow voices soon filled the church .
The choir joined in four - part harmony at each refrain .
The parishioners listened in awe to a carol that was as pure and fresh as an Alpine stream .
" I began to cry every day , and felt anxious , " she recalls .
" It was hard to stay awake .
I wanted to withdraw into my own closed world . "
For many years Barry rode an annual roller coaster of lows and highs .
Autumn and winter brought depression , lethargy - plus a craving for sweets that caused her to gain as much as 30 pounds .
Each spring and summer brought almost manic highs .
She had boundless energy that enabled her to go with little sleep for days and effortlessly shed the excess weight she ' d gained .
By her mid - 40s , these seasonal ups and downs began impairing her work as a writer .
Finally , urged on by her husband , Barry sought professional help .
In 1987 she joined an experimental program at the U . S . National Institute of Mental Health ( NIMH ) in Bethesda , Md .
Research psychiatrist Norman Rosenthal , the program 's director , knew just what Barry was going through .
The gloom of winter had clouded his own moods after he moved from sunny South Africa in 1976 .
He also knew he was n't unique .
" Greek and Roman physicians in ancient times recognized a link between dark moods , lethargy and the change of seasons , " says Rosenthal .
By 1981 , Rosenthal and his NIMH colleagues had identified a medical condition they named Seasonal Affective Disorder , or SAD .
Early research into SAD , now recognized as a distinct kind of clinical depression , was widely discussed in the press .
But since then scientists have made numerous discoveries that have advanced the search for remedies .
Rosenthal 's colleague at the time , Dr . Alfred Lewy , found that increased exposure to bright light in humans could suppress their production of a darkness - related hormone called melatonin .
The light needed to induce this change , Lewy established , was about 2000 lux - about four times brighter than ordinary household lighting .
Rosenthal and his colleagues theorized that if bright light could suppress melatonin secretion , then it might have other effects on the brain , including the reversal of symptoms of depression .
While the precise role of melatonin in SAD has not been pinned down , the theory led to an effective treatment .
By the time Dalene Barry entered the program , this treatment had been established .
She sat for two hours each morning in front of a glowing box of fluorescent bulbs that bathed her with 2500 lux .
" During my fourth day in front of the light box , " she says , " my dark moods started to melt away .
I began to tingle with the kind of joy and energy I felt in summertime . "
" Přibližně u tří ze čtyř lidí , kteří trpí SAD , se stav při této léčbě zlepší - obvykle do tří až sedmi dnů , " říká dr . Rosenthal .
He estimates that more than 11 million adult Americans develop full - blown SAD during winter and another 26 million suffer the milder condition he calls subsyndromal SAD .
Not surprisingly , SAD affects more people where winter nights are longer and days shorter .
At the latitude of Maine or Minnesota , more than 30 percent of the population experiences one of the two kinds of SAD . In Florida it 's less than ten percent .
Carbohydrate Craving .
Scientists are still unsure why winter depression happens .
But a decade of research has turned up some surprising findings :
Nearly 80 percent of SAD victims are women .
Researchers at NIMH are unsure why .
SAD can affect people at any age , but typically it begins around the age of 20 and becomes less common between 40 and 50 .
SAD is comparatively rare in children and adolescents .
Children who are affected often have parents with SAD , suggesting the depression has a genetic component .
Some SAD patients experience shifts in their body clocks when they 're depressed in winter .
They are " morning people " at one time of the year and become " evening people " at another .
What is the underlying difference between people with SAD and others ?
A clue to the answer can be found in carbohydrate craving , a common SAD symptom .
Carbohydrates alter brain chemistry by increasing the level of a soothing chemical called serotonin , a neurotransmitter that carries signals between brain cells .
SAD sufferers crave carbohydrates , say Dr . Richard and Judith Wurtman , researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , because they may need serotonin to lift their mood .
This craving , typically at its strongest from late afternoon through evening , can be intense .
" Some of our patients , " says Rosenthal , " call their desire for candy or cookies an addiction . "
It may be that the serotonin system of the brain has problems regulating itself in SAD sufferers during winter .
Some SAD sufferers respond well to the drug Prozac , thought to influence the brain 's serotonin - using system .
Other brain chemicals and hormones probably play a role in winter depression .
Another neurotransmitter , dopamine , for example , may be inadequate in certain premenopausal women who suffer SAD symptoms .
Ice - Age Survival .
Once , my husband and I never seemed to stop talking .
Bob and I would chat over morning coffee , call each other during the day and curl up on the sofa after dinner , weaving words into a comforter that kept us close and warm .
Then , eight years into our marriage , Julia was born , and our conversations turned to baby talk : bottles and burps , sniffles and smiles .
Topics we used to discuss endlessly - - movies , people , places , feelings - - never crossed our lips .
" It 's just new - baby chaos , " we reassured ourselves .
" It 'll pass . "
But when we eavesdropped on parents with older children , we got nervous .
They sounded like flight engineers at a domestic Mission Control , relaying data about soccer practice and dentist appointments .
I asked my friends when they last really talked with their husbands , like grownups , about grownup things .
Most could not remember .
Is having children incompatible with having meaningful adult conversations ?
Not necessarily , says family therapist Rodney J . Shapiro , director of family therapy at California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco .
Often , busy parents simply get out of the habit of staying in close touch .
" Eventually an emotional distance develops , " Shapiro explains , " and it can be hard to close that gap .
Some couples may stop trying , and that 's when they can get in trouble . "
If you feel out of touch with your spouse and want to reopen the lines of communication , consider the following tips :
1 . Reconnect every day .
" Couples need to talk in a way that makes them feel connected , " says St . Louis psychotherapist Doris Helmering .
Even if you 're so tired you 're ready to drop , spend a few minutes sharing the highs - - and lows - - of each other 's day .
Rather than ask a general question that triggers an automatic response , be specific .
Ask how a big meeting went , whether your spouse likes the new personnel manager .
You 'll show you ' ve been paying attention - - and that you care .
2 . Create opportunities to talk .
" Often couples become overefficient , " notes San Francisco psychotherapist Melody Lowman .
" He goes to the grocery store ; she gets the car washed .
They get more done , but they lose out on time together . "
Casual chitchat while peeling potatoes or washing the car can reinforce your sense of closeness .
" Two people can have a great talk over a double sink while she 's putting on makeup and he 's shaving , " Helmering says .
" What they talk about is less important than sharing something . "
That something may be nothing more than a laugh over the morning funny pages , or a quick update on the latest office romance .
For long talks , make appointments with one another , even if that seems too businesslike .
" Many couples want to be spontaneous , but with children and careers , that 's not realistic , " says Lowman .
" Couples have to make a conscious choice to protect some time as too important for anything but talking . "
Once a week is an absolute minimum ; more is better .
If possible , get out of the house , away from kids and other distractions .
Go for a walk or out to dinner so you can focus on each other .
3 . Discuss outside interests .
It 's important every now and then to exclude the subject of kids - - or the items on your " to do " list - - from your conversation .
Instead , zero in on each other 's interests .
Which topics make your spouse 's eyes light up ?
Think back to the times B . C . ( Before Children ) and the things you used to do together .
Talking about activities you both enjoy - - backpacking , cooking classes , dancing - - can energize a relationship .
4 . Avoid putting your spouse on the defensive .
" When women say , ` Let 's talk , ' many men think , ` She wants to talk about my bad behavior , ' " says Helmering .
" They 're afraid of a lecture on what they should or should n't be doing . "
Husbands and wives should both be aware that nothing puts another person on guard like the word " you , " as in " You always . . . . "
Stick with " I " statements and avoid criticism - - stated or subtle - - so your partner will realize he or she has nothing to fear .
When you do have a gripe , also offer a possible solution .
Saying " I feel we 're out of touch " throws the problem to your partner .
If you add , " I think we should sit down every night and have a cup of tea together after the kids are in bed , " you ' ve offered a practical suggestion .
Ann McGinn began sneaking cigarettes from her mother when she was 12 .
By age 18 she was smoking a pack a day and boasted of having taught her older sister to smoke .
By the time she reached her 20s , her daily fix had doubled .
" Most mornings I ' d light a cigarette within minutes of waking up , " says McGinn , a secretary in Quincy , Mass .
" I planned my life around smoking . "
While relishing the warm rush of smoke sucked into her lungs , she overlooked the hacking cough and chronic bronchitis she developed .
But at age 40 , she could no longer ignore her body 's distress calls .
" I thought , I want a better life , " McGinn says .
She decided she needed to quit .
While more than 44 million Americans had sworn off cigarettes by 1990 , the percentage of women quitting was slightly lower than that of men .
And each day about 1500 young women light up for the first time , joining 22.2 million other female smokers in the this country .
If trends continue , female smokers in the United States will outnumber their male counterparts ( 24 million ) by the end of the decade .
" For many years , lung cancer was considered a man 's disease , but now it is the leading cause of cancer death among American women , " said U . S . Surgeon General Antonia C . Novello in a 1990 speech .
Although smoking - related deaths among men are declining , it is expected that the rates for women will keep rising into the next century .
And in some ways smoking is actually harsher on women than on men .
Women who smoke are at risk for all of the same smoking - related diseases as men , plus ones related to the female reproductive system and pregnancy .
To make matters worse , women tend to develop a type of lung cancer called adenocarcinoma .
This malignancy grows faster and spreads to distant organs more often than squamous - cell carcinoma , which men are more apt to get .
Female smokers may also develop chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases ( COPD ) - - including asthma , emphysema and bronchitis - - earlier than men do .
" Men usually develop emphysema in their 60s and 70s , " says Dr . Alfred Munzer , president of the American Lung Association .
" But I ' m seeing more women in their late 40s and early 50s with totally disabling emphysema . "
What accounts for this disparity ?
Because women 's respiratory passages are smaller than men 's , they seem to be more sensitive to tobacco , says Dr . James Kiley , chief of airway diseases at the U . S . National Heart , Lung and Blood Institute in Bethesda , Md .
Women who smoke expose themselves to a variety of other health risks , including cardiovascular disease .
Smoking as few as one to four cigarettes a day may increase a woman 's risk of heart attack by two to three times .
The habit can also lead to stroke and cancers of the oral cavity , pharynx , larynx , esophagus , kidney and bladder .
And it contributes to cataracts and to cancers of the pancreas and cervix .
Female smokers may experience irregular menstrual cycles , take longer to conceive and have a greater risk of ectopic pregnancy , according to the 1990 U . S . Surgeon General 's report .
Women who smoke during pregnancy are more likely to experience bleeding , premature rupture of the membranes , spontaneous abortion and preterm delivery .
Evidence also suggests that cigarette smoking , which causes an estrogen deficiency in women , increases the risk of osteoporosis and early menopause .
Postmenopausal women who smoke and take estrogen - replacement therapy may lose its protective effect , according to a study by Dr . Douglas Kiel , assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School .
" Women who took estrogen and were smokers had the same risk of hip fracture as those who did n't take estrogen , " he says .
Even if a woman has smoked for years , quitting can have a powerfully positive effect on her long - term health .
Within ten years of quitting , the risk of lung cancer falls to 30 to 50 percent that of smokers .
After 15 years of abstinence , the risk of heart disease is comparable to that of women who have never smoked .
In smokers without COPD , stopping smoking improves pulmonary function within the first few months .
In just the first few years of cessation , the risk of cervical cancer drops substantially .
Quitting , however , is difficult .
" Women often use cigarettes to handle all their negative emotions , like stress , depression , loneliness and anger , " says epidemiologist Peggy O ' Hara , an epidemiologist at the University of Miami School of Medicine in Florida .
Some studies suggest women who stop smoking may have more intense cravings for cigarettes than do men who quit , says Dr . Susan Fiester , medical director of the Psychiatric Institute in Washington , D . C .
This may be because there 's a biological difference in the way men and women respond to nicotine .
Research conducted by Cynthia Pomerleau of the University of Michigan found that even when women smoke fewer cigarettes than men , they achieve comparable blood nicotine levels .
This suggests , says Pomerleau , " that the effects of a given dose of nicotine may be more pronounced in women than in men . "
One of the greatest deterrents to giving up cigarettes is the fear of gaining weight , a concern women consistently report more than men .
One reason is that women seem to have a different pattern of weight gain , according to preliminary evidence from the Lung Health Study sponsored by the U . S . National Heart , Lung and Blood Institute .
" It appears that men gain the most within the first three months after quitting , and then stabilize , " says O ' Hara .
" Women continue to show gains over the first year . "
Still , the average woman who quits will gain only five to eight pounds .
According to a 1990 report in the Journal of the American Medical Association , smokers who quit cold turkey have success rates approaching 50 percent and are more likely to remain abstinent than those who try tapering off .
" Cold turkey hurts the most , for the least amount of time , " says Doug Coleman , a trainer for the American Cancer Society 's Fresh Start smoking - cessation program .
Making mistakes and showing them to her .
Ripping them out and redoing the work .
My grandmother smiled at my intentness , a smile whose dimples were still beguiling .
She told stories , while we worked , about the Swedish people in Minnesota where we came from , about my mother when she was little , about her brothers and sisters .
I remember the attic room as a place of beauty and peace .
After my grandmother died and we moved , my parents bought me a sewing machine of my own .
She was electric .
Though her body was also steel , it was not black with filigree but tan .
Where her forerunner had curves , she was streamlined , like the cars of her era .
She sewed forward and backward , of course , but she also made zigzags , large ones or small ones , fine enough to finish a buttonhole .
In the new house , I sat in my bedroom and made rebellious clothes .
Bell - bottom trousers with plate - sized flowers in red , white and blue .
Granny dresses , with high waists and necks .
No more stories about Scandinavian people in the Midwest : Now the needle thump - thumped to the Beatles , to the Rolling Stones , to the Supremes , to the Beach Boys .
I also sewed for my mother .
It skips a generation , my grandmother used to say , and in our family that was true .
When she grew too old to sew for my mother , I was old enough to start .
My mother never learned .
And so the bell - bottoms and granny dresses were interspersed with other things :
a bottle - green silk suit with lime - green lapels and a blouse to match . A pink silk nightgown with lace trim , which she left in a hotel once and mourned as long as she lived .
Later my daughters joined the sorority : a christening dress with 20 yards of embroidered ruffles , and corduroy overalls , the inner legs closed with snaps for quick diaper changes .
But gradually my production slowed and then stopped .
The pursuit of professional competence and my desire to succeed left many gentle nourishments in the dust .
Marriage was one .
Sewing was another .
The tan , streamlined beauty whose hum had accompanied so many parts of my life lay , unused , on the closet floor .
I did n't have time .
And I did n't want to have time .
I was a thinker , a leader and a doer .
I unconsciously billed myself by the hour for everything I did , computing the " real " cost .
Of everything .
I was too busy to cook - - we ate out a lot .
We moved to a condominium , where someone else would do the maintenance while I did my work .
It no longer seemed a wise use of my time to sew .
And so one day I put my friend out with the trash .
My youngest child is almost grown , and I am astonished at how brief this era has been .
I am aware that the decades left to me will seem even briefer , so they had better be sweet .
If I do not capture and celebrate what art I have , it will die .
If I do not connect myself with my own past in the things I do now , I will remain adrift from it .
Those whom I have loved in the past cannot catch hold of me , for they are dead .
It is I who must catch them .
My new husband has been working in the garden , pulling up maple saplings .
He comes inside , down into the cozy warmth of my sewing room .
He finds me at my new machine . She has a free arm for cuffs and collars , a self - winding bobbin , 14 different kinds of stitches and a built - in buttonholer .
She can sew with two needles at the same time .
She is high - tech white , and most of her is plastic .
I am working on a madras sundress for my granddaughter .
One daughter sits on a heap of pillows in the corner , and we are talking quietly about nothing much .
I come to the end of a seam , raise the needle and automatically reach around to the back , where the presser foot lifter was on my grandmother 's machine .
I stop for a moment , missing her .
Eight - year - old William awoke early that Christmas morning , eager to see what was under our tree .
When he found the skis , he looked faintly disappointed .
Skis had not been high on his wish list , but I knew my son would need them for an upcoming family trip .
" Thanks , " he said softly .
As it turned out , the skis were the best gift he ever received .
William took to the sport his first day on the slopes .
Soon an instructor persuaded him to join the resort 's junior race program .
For the next ten years , William skied every winter weekend .
Those first skis were soon replaced , but they had already bestowed benefits far more lasting than the model train , bicycle and record player that succeeded them .
The skis taught William self - discipline and persistence .
Each winter weekend morning , sometimes in subzero cold , the budding racer had to pull himself from bed to be on the mountain by 8 a . m .
When he fell , he got up and tried again .
At home , he learned to budget his time to allow for homework and workouts .
As a racer , William never rose to Olympic caliber .
But today he is a hard - working , focused 23 - year - old , willing to dare because he is not afraid to fail .
I sometimes wonder how different he might be if he ' d received some other gift that Christmas .
This holiday season , we We all hope to give gifts whose value will outlive the gifts themselves .
Sometimes we anticipate their lasting value . Sometimes the " value added " is an unplanned extra .
When parents pick gifts for their children , of course , the challenge - - and the rewards - - are the greatest of all .
We want to give gifts that will broaden and brighten a child 's world and be remembered for years to come .
" A gift is not merely something material , " declares child development expert Barbara Nordhaus of the Yale Child Study Center .
" It 's an expression of love and caring .
Giving your children specially chosen gifts is part of the parents ' role of nurturing and stimulating . "
How can you choose gifts that will benefit your child over the years ?
Keep these guidelines in mind :
Start out simple .
Gifts do n't have to be expensive or elaborate to have enduring value .
When I was eight , I found a pocket flashlight in my Christmas stocking .
It was the simplest of gifts - - a " stocking stuffer . "
But I was delighted .
The flashlight allowed me to read under the blankets at night without my parents knowing .
That started a habit of nighttime reading that continues .
For novelist Joyce Carol Oates , her most memorable gifts were the most humble ones .
Growing up near Buffalo , N . Y . , in an area where winters can be bitter , Oates received " hand - sewn and knitted things - - dresses , mitten - and - cap sets , sweaters of the softest angora wool .
What effort must have gone into these gifts ! "
Equally memorable - - and simple - - was her first book , Alice 's Adventures in Wonderland and Through the Looking Glass ,
" a gift from my grandmother , which I prize to this day , " she says .
Match the child 's interests .
Fathers give their sons footballs , mothers give their daughters dolls , because that 's what they enjoyed as children .
But Johnny is n't Dad , and Mary is n't Mom .
" Gifts should n't be given to carry out a parent 's agenda , " Nordhaus says .
" They should be picked for the child , not the parent .
Kids tell you who they are , verbally and nonverbally . "
An attentive parent can gauge what a child likes and choose a gift accordingly .
If your child asks for something specific , consider it carefully .
When five - year - old Mark Huggins insisted he wanted a violin for Christmas , his mother dismissed his request as a youngster 's whim .
Mark persisted , and Ellie Huggins finally gave in .
Today , 30 years later , Mark is associate concertmaster of the Pittsburgh Symphony a symphony orchestra .
Challenge your child .
Often the best gifts are those that children grow into , not out of .
" Honey , we 're dead , " Linda moaned , as the van plunged down a steep hill and rolled over .
Linda , who had neglected to wear her seat belt , was tossed from the driver 's seat like a rag doll .
Her body slammed into the console between the front seats , and she felt a crushing pain in her lower abdomen .
Then her head rammed and shattered the windshield .
She was knocked cold .
Linda awoke to a quiet , strange world .
The van had come to rest on its right side .
She was sitting on the passenger window with Honey , wide - eyed , on her lap .
To her left lay the dislodged passenger seat and , jammed between it and the now - vertical floor , her electric wheelchair .
The headlights shone dimly , illuminating a thickly wooded area .
The clock on the dashboard read 2 : 20 .
The sliding panel door had partly opened , and the icy night breeze made Linda shiver .
Aside from her windbreaker , she wore only a T - shirt and thin leggings .
She felt as though she had been pummeled with a baseball bat .
Reflexively , she touched her side to check the stabbing pain in her ribs .
Something 's broken , she thought , wincing .
Bits of glass clung to her hair and formed a shimmering sea around her .
Where are we ?
Slowly , she remembered going off the road just past Exit 10 southeast of Hartford .
She could hear an occasional car but had no idea how far she was from the highway .
She thought back to the menacing flatbed .
The driver must have known he hit me .
He has to stop , or at least get the police !
But , as time wore on , Linda heard only low music from the radio , a soft chorus of chirping crickets and the sound of water running close by .
Then she remembered the telephone .
She found it lodged under the gas and brake pedals above her head .
Using her left hand to brace her feeble right arm , she got hold of the phone and dialed 911 .
Busy .
That 's strange , she thought .
Linda had worked as a police dispatcher and knew emergency lines should never be busy .
She dialed Don 's number .
Also busy .
Without realizing it , Linda had driven beyond range of any of the antennas that make car phones work .
But she had another recourse .
Don had installed a CB radio in her van .
She flipped it on .
The radio was tuned to 19 , the channel frequently used by truckers , but all Linda could hear was a static - filled jumble of voices .
" Breaker one - nine .
I ' m on a ten - thirty - three , " she said , giving the code for emergencies .
No one seemed to hear her .
" Breaker one - nine , breaker , breaker ! "
Still no answer .
The van 's headlights faded , and the CB went silent .
The battery was dead . The radio and telephone were without power .
Linda felt a wave of despair , but steeled herself to resist it .
She had always been a survivor .
Doctors had predicted she would n't live past 16 .
Now she was well beyond that , and had always made sure her life was full of activity , friends and hope .
When daylight comes , someone will see us , she thought .
She willed her body to leave its uncomfortable place on the window but found herself too weak to move even an inch .
